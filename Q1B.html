      <td>The Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) is enhancing its monitoring of the financial sector and, in cooperation with European and Finnish authorities, has adopted measures to promote access to funding and the smooth functioning of the markets despite the pandemic. The FIN-FSA confirms, in line with the decisions taken by the European Central Bank, that banks are temporarily exempt from fulfilling certain additional capital and liquidity requirements. This will facilitate credit institutions’ ability to provide funding to non-financial corporations and households and will alleviate the negative economic effects of the pandemic. The Board of the FIN-FSA has started work on an immediate review of the level of capital requirements that are subject to national decision-making.

      <td>The complexity of the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19 requires an exceptional effort by the international scientific community. On March 24, the DG-RTD of the European Commission has convened a meeting of the Research DGs of the 27 Member States for a first brainstorming on i) priorities for EU coordinated R&amp;I action on Covid-19 in the short (6 months) and medium term (12 months) and beyond; ii) actions to be undertaken by Member States and the European Commission to best maximise funding (e.g. to complement and expand the already launched Covid-19 projects under Horizon2020); iii) how to mobilise State long-term investors.<br>In this context, Italy proposes to establish a panel of high-level experts which could bridge and co-ordinate the scientific/public health domain with the wider societal domain (something similar to the ‘Mission Boards’), and would allow also the scientific efforts and the interactions with non-EU countries (e.g. USA, China, etc.) to be better co-ordinated. Furthermore, this ‘board’ could guarantee to have one strategy for COVID-19 (with standardized policies) across countries, also during the crucial post-quarantine phase, in order to insure that the results obtained during the quarantine/isolation do not get nullified.<br></td>
