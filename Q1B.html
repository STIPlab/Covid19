The FIN-FSA confirms, in line with the decisions taken by the European Central Bank, that banks are temporarily exempt from fulfilling certain additional capital and liquidity requirements. This will facilitate credit institutions’ ability to provide funding to non-financial corporations and households and will alleviate the negative economic effects of the pandemic. The Board of the FIN-FSA has started work on an immediate review of the level of capital requirements that are subject to national decision-making.

EU Member States are closely working together and joining forces at EU-level.  The European Commission (DG RTD) has collected input from all member states on their R&amp;D activities. The European Commission is also organizing discussions with the ministries of the member states. (We assume that further information will be provided by the EU.) <br>Germany is also closely working together with G7- and G20-member states. <br><br>The recently adopted G7 Leaders’ statement expresses “our conviction that current challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic need a strongly coordinated international approach, based on science and evidence, consistent with our democratic values, and utilizing the strengths of private enterprise.” The G7 “will increase coordinated research efforts, including through voluntary support for the global alliance Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation.  We will support the launch of joint research projects funded by both public and private resources, and the sharing of facilities, towards rapid development, manufacture and distribution of treatments and a vaccine, adhering to the principles of efficacy, safety, and accessibility.”<br><br>Germany urges to increase investment in research and development for new vaccines, therapies and diagnostics, to strengthen international cooperation and to follow the recommendations of WHO.  Germany, for example, invites G20 countries to also support Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in their effort to develop a vaccine against SARS-Cov2. The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research decided to support CEPI  with additional 140 million € to support R&amp;D on new vaccines against Covid-19.<br><br>Germany exchanges information with other international state or philanthropic sponsors under the WHO umbrella in order to achieve the most targeted and coordinated investment possible for the research funds available worldwide. The co-operation with the “Global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness network” (GloPID-R) is most relevant.

      <td>The complexity of the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19 requires an exceptional effort by the international scientific community. On March 24, the DG-RTD of the European Commission has convened a meeting of the Research DGs of the 27 Member States for a first brainstorming on i) priorities for EU coordinated R&amp;I action on Covid-19 in the short (6 months) and medium term (12 months) and beyond; ii) actions to be undertaken by Member States and the European Commission to best maximise funding (e.g. to complement and expand the already launched Covid-19 projects under Horizon2020); iii) how to mobilise State long-term investors.<br>In this context, Italy proposes to establish a panel of high-level experts which could bridge and co-ordinate the scientific/public health domain with the wider societal domain (something similar to the ‘Mission Boards’), and would allow also the scientific efforts and the interactions with non-EU countries (e.g. USA, China, etc.) to be better co-ordinated. Furthermore, this ‘board’ could guarantee to have one strategy for COVID-19 (with standardized policies) across countries, also during the crucial post-quarantine phase, in order to insure that the results obtained during the quarantine/isolation do not get nullified.<br></td>
