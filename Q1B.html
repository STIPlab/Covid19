This will facilitate credit institutions’ ability to provide funding to non-financial corporations and households and will alleviate the negative economic effects of the pandemic.

EU Member States are closely working together and joining forces at EU-level. The European Commission (DG RTD) has collected input from all member states on their R&amp;D activities. The European Commission is also organizing discussions with the ministries of the member states. (We assume that further information will be provided by the EU.) <br><br>Germany is also closely working together with G7 and G20 member states. The recently adopted G7 Leaders’ statement expresses “our conviction that current challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic need a strongly coordinated international approach, based on science and evidence, consistent with our democratic values, and utilizing the strengths of private enterprise.” The G7 “will increase coordinated research efforts, including through voluntary support for the global alliance Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation.  We will support the launch of joint research projects funded by both public and private resources, and the sharing of facilities, towards rapid development, manufacture and distribution of treatments and a vaccine, adhering to the principles of efficacy, safety, and accessibility.”<br><br>Germany urges to increase investment in research and development for new vaccines, therapies and diagnostics, to strengthen international cooperation and to follow the recommendations of WHO. Germany, for example, invites G20 countries to also support the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in their effort to develop a vaccine against SARS-Cov2. The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research decided to support CEPI with an additional 140 million € to support R&amp;D on new vaccines against Covid-19.<br><br>Germany exchanges information with other international state or philanthropic sponsors under the WHO umbrella in order to achieve the most targeted and coordinated investment possible for the research funds available worldwide. The co-operation with the “Global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness network” (GloPID-R) is most relevant (see: <a href="https://www.glopid-r.org/our-work/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/" target="_blank">https://www.glopid-r.org/our-work/novel-...</a>).<br></td>

In the short term Spain’ priorities include: <br>(1) Addition of laboratory testing – strategies, capacities in Member States; <br>(2) Digital solutions for healthcare advice and prompt sharing of clinical practices; (3) full open access to research results and research data; <br>(4) Additional public funding for research and innovation in COVID-19 both EU and national sources, in full synergy.<br>(5) Set up a platform to coordinate R&amp;I activities and national, EU and international level including specific areas such as vaccines, clinical trials, treatments as well as mapping of ongoing research activities.<br>(6) Promote the use of super computing capacities (i.e. Barcelona Supercomputing Center) and shared services at European and international levels.<br><br>In addition, different European groups and initiatives are promoting actions to gather information in specific areas of STI and establish common actions to work jointly.
