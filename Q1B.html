Government agencies (Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), Health Canada (HC), Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and the National Research Council (NRC)) are working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to enhance global coordination, support transparent global research, enable priority setting, and build common research platforms. Canada&#39;s Chief Science Advisor, Dr. Mona Nemer, is in regular contact with the chief science advisors of various countries to exchange information and mobilize global research approaches regarding the COVID-19 response. To help advance research and vaccine development for COVID-19, Canada is participating in the international collaboration, coordinated by the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.<br>o Canada, through CIHR and the International Development Research Centre, is a member of the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), a consortium of funders that facilitates the international rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19. CIHR&#39;s Scientific Director of the Institute of Immunity and Infection is a Vice-Chair of GloPID-R. Canada continues to work with international partners through the GloPID-R and the WHO&#39;s R&amp;D Blueprint to leverage global efforts and avoid duplicative activities. CIHR is one of 67 international research funders that are signatories to a statement to rapidly and openly share COVID-19 research data and findings. <br>o Canada is participating in the WHO&#39;s SOLIDARITY trial, a multi-national clinical trial to study possible treatment options for COVID-19. The goal is to rapidly generate robust data with the same study protocol applied to multiple sites in order to obtain sufficient numbers of patients enrolled in the clinical trial to ensure statistically sound results. Over 70 countries have now confirmed participation. Canada has invested nearly $1 million through the CIHR to support the Canadian arm of this trial. <br>o The CFIA, in partnership with Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) and PHAC, established the Biosafety Level 4 Zoonotic Disease Network (BSL4ZNet) which is a network of 15 government organizations from five different countries (Canada, US, UK, Germany and Australia), each with a responsibility over the regulation of human, animal and zoonotic pathogens with pandemic potential. The BSL4ZNet has been conducting COVID-19 emergency meetings since early January with international partners to facilitate the sharing of scientific information and research capacity needs in a secure and trusted platform. Technical points of contact on COVID-19 research from Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States and Canada represented by the BSL4ZNet secretariat have been sharing updates on research priorities and progress. The CFIA has also contributed knowledge towards the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) risk assessments of COVID-19 on its zoonotic potential and in identifying priority research needs on host pathogen interactions.<br>o NRC, PHAC and CFIA regularly engage with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI), which is a key international funding mechanism for vaccine development. Canada has also provided $14 million to CEPI, which is leading efforts to have COVID-19 vaccine candidates ready for clinical trials by late spring. <br>o HC is engaged with other international regulators to monitor any impacts on the global supply of medicines as a member of the International Pharmaceutical Regulators Programme. PHAC and DRDC are members of the Medical Countermeasures Consortium, in partnership with the Department of National Defence, where they engage with the US, UK and Australian governments to promote collaboration in research, development and acquisition. <br>o In addition, research information is being shared between the 27 regulatory authorities, representing every region in the world, that make up the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities.<br>From <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-government-canada-research-response.html" target="_blank">https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/s...</a><br><br>On May 4, the Government of Canada announced its commitment to co-chair the Coronavirus Global Response initiative (CGRI) with Saudi Arabia in their current G20 presidency role, and Italy in their future G20 presidency role. Other co-chair partners include the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Japan. The CGRI seeks to kick-start an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organizations, foundations, and health care professionals. It is hoped that together they can raise more than $8 billion (USD) by the end of the pledging period to support the development of rapid coronavirus diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines. The partners will also work with the World Health Organization to coordinate and prioritize efforts to vulnerable countries. The funds collected will be channelled into three principal strands: diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines and may also be used to strengthen health systems.<br></td>

In the context of the crisis created by the COVID-19, this initiative would allow us to offer science-based advice to our governments for the sake of improving the decision making process.<br><br>At the international level we have coordinated STI responses with multiple governments across the globe. As a result of our government’s consultation with the government of the Republic of Korea, the latter has agreed to share clinical data and medical devices with Peru. The government of China has been providing technical assistance and scientific advice, moreover, chinese private companies and local governments have provided equipment required for coping with the crisis. With the United Kingdom we are working to redirect Newton Fund resources to research endeavors in the field of COVID-19, making efforts to enable peruvian researchers to participate in the UK and US-led initiative called the Pandemic Challenge and supporting the UK Welcome Trust initiative which advocates for data research data and findings sharing. Through the Pan American Health Organization, our government has participated in a virtual roundtable with experts from China where protocols, methods and best practices were shared to tackle the crisis.<br><br>Within the framework of UNESCO, we have taken part in the Virtual Ministerial Dialogue on COVID-19, Open Science and International Scientific Collaboration. In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have vowed to reinforce scientific cooperation and integrate Open Science in our research programmes to prevent and mitigate global crises  stepping up information sharing through Open Science.We agreed that UNESCO should use its long-standing normative role promoting international scientific collaboration to boost Open Science in order to reduce the knowledge gap, tackle pandemics, address environmental crises and combat other global threats. <br><br></td>
