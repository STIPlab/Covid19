They are also critical levers to ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery, while boosting the resilience of our production sectors, the competitiveness of our economies and the transformation of our socio-economic systems. Research and innovation actions are an essential part of the coordinated EU response to the public health threat of Covid-19. They channel public and private investments and align funding and investment streams to underpin the Recovery. In the current context, we need science-driven solutions, including better scientific understanding of the virus as well as the development of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. R&amp;I also provides the technologies that allow for safer and faster tracking of the virus. In global emergencies, such as the Covid19 pandemic, it is essential to remove all obstacles to the free flow of data, researchers and ideas. Full, timely and fair access to scientific information and research results during crises for researchers, journalists, medical staff and all citizens is of outmost importance for accurate and affordable science-based responses. Moreover, openly accessible, machine-readable, interoperable data is needed to follow the spread of the epidemic, and forecast its rapid evolution. Key datasets include clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data. It is of crucial importance to invest in stronger and more resilient national health systems, capable of rapid and integrated responses drawing on the latest scientific discoveries, with equal access across the EU.</td>

The state aid rules will be more effectively applied, and funding decisions will be done throughout 2020. This also implies a significant renewal of internal procedures in the Research Council of Norway to accommodate larger funding streams and a need for efficiency.
