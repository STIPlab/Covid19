The state aid rules will be more effectively applied, and funding decisions will be done throughout 2020. This also implies a significant renewal of internal procedures in the Research Council of Norway to accommodate larger funding streams and a need for efficiency. Previously agreed timelines for projects may be adapted, allowing for delays or speeding up as appropriate. Requirements for cash contributions may be abandoned to adapt to the tight liquidity situation experienced by many companies.<br><br>Upon request from The Ministry of Higher Education and Research, the Research Council of Norway has proposed measures to alleviate the negative consequences for industry and society.

Some thriving sectors in Portugal, such as tourism and restaurants, have come to a sudden standstill, while others have been able to maintain a certain level of economic activity. The initial package of measures, beyond the strictly public health measures, have focused on providing financial support to business firms, through a variety of measures, including some directed to the most hit sectors mentioned above, as well as measures aimed to support employment, workers and families. While measures have not been aimed specifically at the STI system, beyond those referred to above, aimed at supporting STI system&#39;s contribution to the response to the COVID-19 crisis, the ongoing process of linking of SMEs, start-ups and the research system with larger corporations in broader collaborative initiatives, promoting open innovation and new spaces of co-creation in order to build stronger knowledge and distributed innovation, is expected to have impacts on the economy and on the STI systems beyond the short-term.
