The goal of these dialogues is to create environments where the actors of the national STI system can meet and actively discuss the issues.<br><br>● First Dialogue of Experts<br><br>The First Experts&#39; Dialogue took place on March 17, 2020, proposed by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, Mrs. Mabel Torres. Considering that Colombia is well aware of the vulnerability and susceptibility of its population concerning COVID-19 and its need to generate strong, robust and decisive action as a country against the virus&#39;s effects, the dialogue seeks to be a space for articulation and active discussion among the actors of the national STI system.<br><br>The general purpose of the dialogue was to provide strategic and disruptive elements that will help state institutions strengthen the actions being carried out by the National Health Institute of Colombia, based on the articulation of several actors of the national STI system against COVID-19. The main actors in the first dialogue were the academic sector, public and private institutes (among them the National Health Institute and the Institute for Health Technology Assessment), two delegates from the Indigenous Intercultural Health System, the Academy of Medicine, three experts on artificial intelligence, and the Minister of STI and her team.<br><br>This Dialogue was conceived as an environment for extended, reflexive, constructive, opportune and pro-positive conversation among the actors of the national STI system, therefore some guiding questions were formulated taking into account the current scenario of the COVID-19 from a perspective of the tasks, challenges and responsibilities that we have as a country. The guiding questions were:<br>i) What should be the priority actions for the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation in the framework of COVID-19, aiming at promoting the social appropriation of knowledge in the face of the current Coronavirus pandemic, in order to contribute to its mitigation?<br>ii) How can the academy and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation support the efforts of the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Health to address the COVID-19 pandemic at the national and regional level?<br>iii) How does the current juncture allow us to be better equipped in terms of policies, plans and programs as a country, to face contingencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic?<br>iv) How does the current contingency contribute to the formulation of public STI policy and to strengthening the national STI system?<br><br>● Second Dialogue of Experts<br><br>The Second Experts&#39; Dialogue was held on March 26, 2020, proposed by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, Mrs. Mabel Torres. The objective was to identify from the differential and territorial approach, and taking into account national and international learning: (i) first, the management of the COVID-19 pandemic; and (ii) second, the challenges for research agendas, useful for the production of evidence, as well as for decision making and public policy formulation.<br><br>The main actors in the second dialogue were: 6 experts from the academic sector, including doctors, with specializations in Health Services Management, Public Health, Epidemiology, Molecular Biology and Virology. Two international guests attended, Dr. Oscar Franco, Epidemiologist and Director Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) in Bern, Switzerland, and Edna Martinez, Doctorate in Sociology from the Free University of Berlin. At a national level, guests from the National Planning Department and the Director of Emergencies and Disasters Ministry of Health and Social Protection also attended.<br><br>There was an introductory context on socio-cultural and political phenomena that may influence the response to the COVID-19, during the containment and mitigation phase. Then, each panelists presented from their perspective the current and future challenges in the field of research in aspects of public health, health service provision, social protection interventions, or in the field of comprehensive social intervention, following their expertise (socio-cultural dynamics, world views, practices and knowledge of indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, migrant population). Likewise, an overview of the international experience allowed for the identification of lessons learned in Europe.<br><br>Subsequently, an exchange of ideas and proposals was promoted with the attendees, in order to establish the challenges and responsibilities that correspond to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, as well as those of other sectors or responses that require a sectoral response.<br><br>Finally, an analysis of the research challenges or technological or innovation alternatives potentially useful for the contingency was carried out. The guiding questions were:<br>i) Taking into account territorial differences and social determinants, how should the COVID-19 Pandemic be dealt with?<br>ii) How do socio-cultural and political dynamics or ethnic characteristics affect the approach to the pandemic?<br>iii) How can the problems of accessibility and opportunity to provide services and the territorial capacities be overcome with the support of Science, Technology and Innovation?<br>iv) What alternatives are foreseen for regions with public order problems, migrant population, floating population, for a comprehensive approach to the pandemic?<br>v) What are the lessons learned and significant experiences that would stand out abroad during the first months? Which should not be repeated?<br>vi) What would you incorporate as a priority for research or innovation? <br></td>
