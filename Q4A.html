The platform combines: a mobile app for citizens; a web app for medical personnel; a back-end for data aggregation and; an AI system to train models. All these components work together to map potential infected clusters, hotspots and super spreading. Contact tracing can furthermore be done more efficiently. Privacy experts have been involved from day one.<br><br>See also answers to questions Q1A et Q3.<br></td>

This is rapidly growing voluntary pro bono expert network growing organically and working across professional and organizational borders with various digital tools and platforms to solve various complex problems that ministries are currently struggling with. Expertise is composed to fit for the each complex task so that Fast Expert Teams can tackle various problems quickly. Team is led by Professor Kirsimarja Blomqvist from LUT University.

An additional appropriation of EUR 12.8 million is proposed for the operating expenses of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare for the expenditure arising from the coronavirus. The additional appropriation is intended for purposes such as disseminating information and raising awareness among citizens, for safeguarding the functioning of information systems and for maintaining laboratory capacity.  Altogether, EUR 6 million of the additional appropriation will be allocated to a broad-based research consortium for research into the coronavirus epidemic, in particular for developing rapid diagnostic methods and research into the emergence of immunity and for creating a national monitoring system for it. Of the additional funding allocated to research, EUR 4 million will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</td>

      <td>The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research is funding the development of a research network with 150 Mio. € in order to bundle and strengthen the research activities of German university medicine in the context of the current pandemic crisis. The initiative shall bring together and evaluate the action plans, diagnostic and treatment strategies of all German university clinics. At all university hospitals, the data of the treated COVID-19 patients are also systematically recorded and bundled in a database. In this way, the medical histories or data on the constitution of the patients can be merged. Scientists who are not active in medical research can also gain access to this data collection. Their research will flank the work of doctors. The data set will help generating valid and useful knowledge on the individual treatment of patients, pandemic management, but also with regard to vaccine and therapy development. The Federal Government will set up a task force. The task force will coordinate university medicine and politics. Various other scientific networks are also to be included.</td>
