    <tr>
      <th>What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>The COVID response is being led by the NZ Ministry of Health and Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, via an inter-agency coordination group.  It is taking account of the latest scientific advice from both international and domestic sources.</td>

      <td>NaN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Advice to the public on COVID is led/communicated by NZ Prime Minister and the Ministry of Health, via regular press conferences, social media updates and a dedicated website https://covid19.govt.nz/ These communications are acting on the latest scientific advice.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>The New Zealand Health Research Council has issued two calls for research relating to COVID.  These can be found here https://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-events/covid-19-research-funding-opportunities-available-now</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>We are still assessing the impact, particularly on international travel and collaboration, and also as remote working becomes standard.  As of 26/3/02 it is too early to begin considering any widespread measures for the science system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Is support of the STI system part of planned stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy?</th>
      <td>Currently no, beyond those non-specific measures that might apply to scientists as members of the general population (for example, NZ has legislated for temporary limitations on rent increases and a ban on evictions).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Is there anything else regarding the STI policy response to Covid-19 in your country you would like to mention?</th>
      <td>Please note we have only provided brief responses to this survey at this point in time as we consider the priority for those involved with managing the response is to focus on that.  We have therefore not consulted widely within various agencies responsible for managing the COVID response.</td>
