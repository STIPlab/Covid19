    <tr>
      <th>Q1A. What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>The COVID response is being led by the NZ Ministry of Health and Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, via an inter-agency coordination group. It is taking account of the latest scientific advice from both international and domestic sources.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q1B. In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>[Left blank]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q2.Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Advice to the public on COVID is led/communicated by NZ Prime Minister and the Ministry of Health, via regular press conferences, social media updates and a dedicated website <a href="https://covid19.govt.nz/" target="_blank">https://covid19.govt.nz/</a> These communications are acting on the latest scientific advice.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q3. What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>The New Zealand Health Research Council and the Ministry of Health have issued two calls for research relating to COVID.  These can be found here <a href="https://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-events/covid-19-research-funding-opportunities-available-now" target="_blank">https://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-events/...</a> <br><br>OECD Secretariat additions (30 March 2020):<br>On 2 March 2020, the Health Research Council of New Zealand and the Ministry of Health announced a NZ$3 million (USD 1.8 million) rapid research response fund for projects contributing to global COVID-19 efforts (<a href="https://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-events/covid-19-research-funding-opportunities-available-now" target="_blank">https://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-events/...</a> ). NZ$1 million (USD 0.6 million) will be allocated to projects that can provide responses to the current disease threat in the short term (within 3-6 months), and NZ$2 million (USD 1.2 million) to fund research that strengthens New Zealand’s research capacity and response to emerging infectious disease threats. Proposals are invited from all fields of health and social science. <br></td>

    <tr>
      <th>Q4A. At national level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>[Left blank]</td>

    <tr>
      <th>Q4B. At international level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>[Left blank]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q5. What novel approaches, if any, is your country using to address the coronavirus crisis (e.g. use of machine learning, open science initiatives boosting access and sharing of data and research results, development and use of prediction models, etc.)?</th>
      <td>[Left blank]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q6A. What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>We are still assessing the impact, particularly on international travel and collaboration, and also as remote working becomes standard.  As of 26/3/02 it was too early to begin considering any widespread measures for the science system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q6B. Is support of the STI system part of planned stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy?</th>
      <td>Currently no, beyond those non-specific measures that might apply to scientists as members of the general population (for example, NZ has legislated for temporary limitations on rent increases and a ban on evictions).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q7. Is there anything else regarding the STI policy response to Covid-19 in your country you would like to mention?</th>
      <td>Please note we have only provided brief responses to this survey at this point in time as we consider the priority for those involved with managing the response is to focus on that.  We have therefore not consulted widely within various agencies responsible for managing the COVID response.</td>
