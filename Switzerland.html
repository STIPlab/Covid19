      <td>Policymaking requires a broad range of knowledge. To acquire and develop this knowledge, the federal administration carries out or commissions research activities. In view of the diversity of problems, the responsibility of research in government lies with the various specialized offices. In addition, these offices have their own specific networks and commissions to advise them.<br><br>In general, the government works closely with research. In the current crisis, the federal government wants to make even greater use of the potential of the Swiss scientific community. A scientific advisory group will answer ad hoc questions to the federal government, if necessary involving other researchers; see Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force (<a href="https://ncs-tf.ch/en/" target="_blank">https://ncs-tf.ch/en/</a>).<br><br>The Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force is:<br>- providing the Federal Council Coronavirus Crisis Unit KSBC, the Federal Department of Home Affairs FDHA (Federal Office of Public Health FOPH) and the Federal           Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research EAER (State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI) with its scientific knowledge to assist the political authorities decision–makers in reaching decisions;<br>- acting as an advisory body to the cantonal authorities on scientific matters;<br>- identifying fields and opportunities for research where the Swiss scientific community can make an important contribution to understanding and combating COVID-19;<br>- identifying opportunities for innovation where Swiss scientific know-how can contribute to COVID-19 related products or services.<br><br>Ten expert groups (as of Mai 11th 2020) are focusing on the most urgent and time critical issues. Further expert groups may be set up according to emerging needs and in close cooperation and consultation with the commissioning bodies (Mandate, Topics &amp; Expert groups, Policy Briefs, Situation report etc. see <a href="https://ncs-tf.ch/en/" target="_blank">https://ncs-tf.ch/en/</a>).<br><br>On March 20th 2020, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences issued medical-ethical guidelines for triage in intensive care units. They apply when an emergency occurs with a large number of seriously ill patients and rationing decisions will be necessary (<a href="https://www.samw.ch/en/Ethics/Topics-A-to-Z/Intensive-care-medicine.html" target="_blank">https://www.samw.ch/en/Ethics/Topics-A-t...</a>).

Swiss research institutions are contributing to six of the seventeen project funded by Horizon 2020 through the ad-hoc call. Currently researchers are preparing proposals for the ad-hoc call of IMI.<br><br>Switzerland is involved in the European Open Science Cloud, which supports the set-up of a European COVID-19 Data platform based on the EMBL_EIB initiative.

      <td>Two times a week, the government provides information at the highest level (Federal Council) at press conferences. This is supplemented by information from experts.<br><br>The Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force was set up to act as a scientific advisory body to the political authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Task Force is publishing Policy Briefs that focus on a wide range of the most pressing scientific issues to better understanding and managing the pandemic (see <a href="https://ncs-tf.ch/en/policy-briefs" target="_blank">https://ncs-tf.ch/en/policy-briefs</a>). The Task Force is currently preparing lay summaries of the published Policy briefs, to ensure that the information reaches a broader audience.<br><br>The dialogue between science and society is one of the main tasks of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences.

      <th>Q5. What novel approaches, if any, is your country using to address the coronavirus crisis (e.g. use of machine learning, open science initiatives boosting access and sharing of data and research results, development and use of prediction models, etc.)?</th>
      <td>The Federal Council has set up a Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force, which provided science advice to the governmental and cantonal actors in charge of the crisis management. The Science Task Force consists of a group of around 70 high profile scientists working on ten topics. Based on the available scientific evidence, the Task Force provides recommendations in Policy Briefs, which are publicly available at <a href="http://www.ncsf-tf.ch" target="_blank">www.ncsf-tf.ch</a>. Mathematical Modelling is one of the Expert Groups providing actively advice to the Federal Government. Prediction models to describe the epidemic are publicly available on the Task Force website. They are regularly updated. Furthermore, the Digital Epidemiology Expert Group substantially contributes to shaping the testing-tracing-isolating-quarantining strategy. Experts from the EPFL participating in this group developed a proximity app, which should support digital tracing and keep the number of new cases low.<br><br>Research data under the SNSF Special Call and the NRP 78 &#34;Covid-19&#34; must be made available for researchers and authorities worldwide and without delay at the latest at the end of the project.<br><br>The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) has set up special registry for Covid-19 research including projects of the SNSF, Innosuisse and EU-projects with Swiss participation (<a href="http://www.snf.ch/de/fokusForschung/newsroom/Seiten/news-200518-uebersicht-schweizer-forschung-zu-covid-19.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.snf.ch/de/fokusForschung/news...</a>).<br><br>On March 24th 2020, Swiss Universities, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries appealed to all publishing houses to remove paywalls on scientific publications supporting by this way the appeal of the International Coalition of Library Consortia (ICOLC).
