    <tr>
      <th>What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Policymaking requires a broad range of knowledge. To acquire and develop this knowledge, the federal administration carries out or commissions research activities. In view of the diversity of problems, the responsibility of research in government lies with the various specialized offices. In addition, these offices have their own specific networks and commissions to advise them.<br><br>In general, the government works closely with research. In the current crisis, the federal government now wants to make even greater use of the potential of the Swiss scientific community. A scientific advisory group will answer ad hoc questions to the federal government, if necessary involving other researchers; see Science Advisory Group (SAB) (see Q.6B)<br><br>On March 20th, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences issued medical-ethical guidelines for triage in intensive care units. They apply when an emergency occurs with a large number of seriously ill patients and rationing decisions will be necessary.<br><br>On behalf of Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) the Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+) has established a virtual platform where Swiss public health scientists provide epidemiological expertise to FOPH.<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>The Swiss STI system is already strongly based on cooperation between the various players and is internationally well networked.<br><br>Switzerland is involved in the WHO multi-country solidarity trial with several study centers.<br><br>Swiss delegates in the Horizon 2020 Program Committees (Health, Innovative Medicine Initiative and Research Infrastructures) are involved in the development of the calls for proposal with specific focus on SARS-CoV-2. Swiss research institutions are contributing to six of the seventeen project funded by Horizon 2020 through the ad-hoc call. Currently researchers are preparing proposals for the ad-hoc call of IMI.<br><br>Switzerland is involved in the European Open Science Cloud, which now is discussing the set-up of a European COVID-19 Data platform in close coordination with the WHO. Switzerland will contribute to this platform as soon as more information is available.<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Two times a week, the government provides information at the highest level (Federal Council) at press conferences. This is supplemented by information from experts.<br><br>The dialogue between science and society is one of the main tasks of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. Recently, the released a COVID19 related video entitled “What Swiss Scientists want Young People to know”.<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>For the description of the comprehensive support package of the federal council, see Q6.B.<br><br>In addition, it is worth mentioning the Swiss participation in international clinical trials by Gilead.<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>At national level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>

      <th>At international level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Switzerland is part of the European Open Science Cloud, which now is discussing the set-up of a European COVID-19 Data platform in close coordination with the WHO. Switzerland will contribute to this platform as soon as more information is available.<br><br>Many activities of individual organisations are going on. One example: In response to the Covid-19 crisis, EMBL-EBI is offering new services and especially Data Hub resources to the scientists from Member States. The Swiss community has been informed of the possibility and has shown interest in using the new services. The international research organisations in the area of life sciences (EMBL but also others like ELIXIR) have responded to the crisis not only by locking down most of their infrastructure to protect the staff but also by adopting strategies and offering new services in order to contribute to the ongoing research efforts to resolve the crisis.<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What novel approaches, if any, is your country using to address the coronavirus crisis (e.g. use of machine learning, open science initiatives boosting access and sharing of data and research results, development and use of prediction models, etc.)?</th>
      <td>Research data under the SNSF Special Call (see Q6.B) must be made available for researchers and authorities worldwide and without delay at the latest at the end of the project (see Q3).<br><br>On March 24th swissuniversities, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries appealed to all publishing houses to remove paywalls on scientific publications supporting by this way the appeal of the International Coalition of Library Consortia ICOLC. In the current exceptional circumstances, scientific results need to be shared immediately and transparently to bolster the fight against the new virus.<br><br>Virtual SSPH+ expert platform (see Q1.A)<br></td>

    <tr>
      <th>What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>On 16 March, the Federal Council classified the situation in Switzerland as an &#34;extraordinary situation&#34; and introduced various restrictive measures that also affect the functioning of the STI system. The institutions concerned are reacting pragmatically to the problems arising in the short term (e.g. extension of submission deadlines).<br><br>Researchers involved in Horizon 2020 Projects or preparing for upcoming calls have difficulties fulfilling their research activities on time. Switzerland is involved in the discussions with the European Commission, Member States and Associated Countries on how to support ongoing and future research activities accordingly.<br></td>

    <tr>
      <th>Is support of the STI system part of planned stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy?</th>
      <td>The Federal Council is currently doing everything to coordinate the various activities and players in the health and research sector as well as to support the economy to help overcome the corona crisis. The main lines of action are:<br><br>1) Support of the health system (measures: Improving or ensuring monitoring, health care, infrastructure, prevention)<br><br>2) Support for research (measures: Promotion of digital approaches epidemiology and new test methods &amp; vaccines)<br><br>a) Expertise and coordination of the research players via a Science Advisory Group (SAB) coordinated with the Federal Office of Public Health and the ad hoc ETH Domain COVID-19 Task Force (<a href="https://ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain-covid-19-task-force" target="_blank">https://ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain-covid-19...</a>) as well as universities (swissuniversities) and academies.<br><br>b) Special call of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) for research on Covid-19 (call ended on March, 25th). For further details see: <a href="http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/programmes/coronavirus/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/programmes/...</a>. This is the first time that the SNSF is launching a call for proposals in response to current events.<br><br>c) In preparation: Special programme for SARS / Covid-19 research with the aim of developing solutions to combat the pandemic as quickly as possible through research in larger, also collaborative projects (national and international)<br><br>3) Support to the economy. On 13 and 20 March, the Federal Council approved a comprehensive package of measures totaling over CHF 40 billion to cushion the economic consequences of the spread of the coronavirus. The measures include, among others:<br>- Liquidity support for companies<br>- Extension and simplification of the instrument of short-time work compensation<br>- Compensation for loss of earnings for self-employed persons<br></td>
