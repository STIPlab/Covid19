      <td>The Covid-19 scientific council was established on March 11, 2020 by Olivier Véran, French Minister of Solidarity and Health, &#34;to inform public decision in the management of the health situation linked to the coronavirus&#34;. Chaired by Professor Jean-François Delfraissy, this committee has ten other experts who come from complementary disciplinary fields.<br><a href="https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/actualites/presse/communiques-de-presse/article/olivier-veran-installe-un-conseil-scientifique" target="_blank">https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/actual...</a><br><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conseil_scientifique_Covid-19" target="_blank">https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conseil_sc...</a><br><br>The Research Analysis and Expertise Committee (CARE) was installed by the President of the Republic on March 24. The mission of this committee is to advise the government on programs and doctrine relating to coronavirus treatments and tests. He will also look into backtracking practices that identify people in contact with those infected with the Covid-19 virus. This committee brings together 12 researchers and physicians, and is chaired by Francoise Barré-Sanoussi, virologist at the Pasteur / Inserm Institute, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize for the discovery of the AIDS virus.<br><a href="https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2020/03/24/medecins-chercheurs-et-scientifiques-mobilises-contre-le-covid-19" target="_blank">https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/20...</a><br><br>Additional information:<br>In June 2013, under the aegis of the Alliance for Life Sciences and Health,* France launched a consortium called REACTing: REsearch and ACTion targeting emerging infectious diseases. This consortium is organized around a steering committee of 15 human and animal health specialists; it is supported by an 8-member scientific committee and methodological centers. REACTing does not target any particular disease, and can intervene in all infectious emergencies. Its field of action is wide, from basic research to the humanities and social sciences, including the environmental sciences, epidemiology and public health. The approach is transversal and multidisciplinary, because health crises are always complex phenomena in their causes as in their effects.<br><br>REACTing has multiple objectives:<br>• Improve the preparation of research in times of inter-crisis (peacetime): governance, preparation of research tools, identification of research priorities, search for funding, and preparation of the ethical and legal aspects essential for anticipation research projects to be built in an emergency.<br>• Coordinate, finance and set up research projects in times of epidemic crisis: coordination, scientific and strategic priorities, methodological assistance, information for authorities and the general public.<br>• Help with public decision-making and reaffirm the place of research in the response to health problems, alongside aspects of care, logistics, security and geopolitics.<br><br>See: <a href="https://aviesan.fr/aviesan/accueil/toute-l-actualite/reacting-une-approche-multidisciplinaire-pour-relever-le-defi-des-crises-epidemiques" target="_blank">https://aviesan.fr/aviesan/accueil/toute...</a><br>*Aviesan is composed of 9 essential academic players, founding members of Aviesan: the CEA, the CNRS, INRAE, INRIA, INSERM, the Institut Pasteur, the IRD, the conference of university presidents (CPU) and the Conference of Directors General of Regional and University Hospitals.<br></td>
