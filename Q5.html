By avoiding the separate extraction of genetic material, this test saves substantially on critical lab consumables and is also very rapid, with the potential to reduce test turnaround times.<br>• The development of new testing protocols to enable more individuals to be tested simultaneously, while minimising the number of consumables used and maintain the current turnaround times.<br>• Rapidly assessing, trialing, and where relevant, validating new diagnostic test kits to ensure they are of the highest quality.<br>• Assessing how and when to use serology testing. Serology testing could assist with identification of asymptomatic infection, retrospective diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from infection and determining the extent of infection in a population.<br></td>

      <td>In Austria, there are currently numerous initiatives, both from the public and private sector, aiming at providing rapid tests, medication and vaccination. Many of those are embedded in international and European partnerships. The initiatives range from academic spin-offs using AI technology to identify agents, big data analysis on the spread of COVID-19 nationally and internationally, university networks manufacturing sanitiser through novel methods, to the social sciences addressing and supporting the current societal challenges. Since the already significant number is constantly growing, providing a representative overview is impossible at the current time.<br><br>To name one of the above mentioned initiatives, the Complexity Science Hub Vienna (CSH) has offered new calculations with regard to possible scenarios for the spread of Covid-19. Their publication is offered with the suggestion to base all predictions regarding the duration of the measures issued by the Austrian government on patients in intensive care units and deaths, rather than on infection numbers. <br><br>Another initiative that offers advice on the duration of those measures is a research team from the Technical University in Vienna and one of its spin-off companies. They published a simulation calculation that asks to keep the measures issued in place, but that from a scientific point of view at the current time, more restrictions for the general public are unlikely to have an impact. Therefore, additional measures should put their focus on targeted risk groups.</td>

As a consequence, some Belgian universities have already decided to replace face-to-face evaluations with an online expert panel meeting. <br><br>Some Belgian innovators have also seen an opportunity in the negative side effects of social distancing measures. Since queuing and grouping at authorized locations (food stores, pharmacies, hospitals, parks, etc.) may be problematic, the Belgian company Seaters – which normally helps to distribute sponsoring tickets for sports and cultural events – has transformed its product into a Virtual Queuing System. Via that system an appointment voucher for authorized locations can be requested. Each voucher mentions an hour of visit that takes into account the social distancing rules (max. 1 person per 10 m2) and the necessary time per person (max. 30 min. for groceries, for example). The demo version of the platform can be activated nationally in 24 hours.<br></td>

Banking of clinical samples from patients infected with SARS- CoV-2 (use and further development of existing bank).<br>2. Development, modelling and certification of antibody detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 to monitor buildup of immunity in the population and the factors having an influence on it; isolation and identification of neutralizing antibodies from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and development of diagnostic methodologies, e.g. seroneutralisation, to detect specific immunity. For this Action, the HPI will collaborate closely with the Pasteur Institute in Paris, a globally recognized leader in infectious diseases research.<br>3. Study of the virological profile, and investigation for presence of defective SARS-CoV-2 forms in serum samples or smears from recovered or deceased patients. This action is expected to contribute to the laboratory assessment of disease outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.<br>4. Study of SARS-CoV-2 patients’ immune response using traditional immunological methods as well as next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. There are already experimental data that SARS-CoV-2 triggers a specific immune response, which differs from that of other related viruses. Viral infection has dramatic effects on the gene expression profile, primarily of immune-system cells. This HPI projects aims at developing specialized treatments for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br>5. Sequencing of the virus genome based on patient samples with a view to studying the molecular evolution of the virus in the Greek population and correlating mutations/polymorphisms with severity of the disease in order to identify highly pathogenic strains. Our goal is to analyze a large number of samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients in Greece in order to achieve full characterization of viral genomes, their host heterogeneity and create a map of the virus spread using phylogeographical analysis.<br>6.

Specifically, Fleming can provide pre-existing animal models or, based on emerging needs from current clinical studies of the virus, generate novel animal models through its specialized units. Additionally, utilizing platforms for the identification of clinical, cellular and molecular markers it can undertake the characterization of underlying clinical, genetic and epigenetic factors that are associated with susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br>• Providing technical expertise and the necessary bioinformatics tools required to analyse viral genetic material in the Greek population towards identification of potential variants associated with increased transmission or virulence. In addition, the Center can apply combinatorial bioinformatic methods on data from patient sample analyses to discover biological markers of the disease, as well as aid in drug repurposing. BSRC Fleming’s researchers are already collaborating with international teams in basic research projects to discover therapeutic targets by modelling and analysing viral – host protein interaction networks. All data from these actions will be freely available to the scientific community in order to accelerate research against COVID-19.<br>• At the European level, Fleming participates in efforts to tackle the pandemic as coordinator of two National Research Infrastructures, InfrafrontierGR and ELIXIR-GR, and as a core partner of their respective European networks INFRAFRONTIER and ELIXIR, that are already engaged in actions against COVID-19.

In this context and with a view to promoting scientific research on COVID-19 disease, “Demokritos” launches a challenge which will use the AI software tools of the BioASQ project to answer scientific questions on the coronavirus. Through this process, our goal is to facilitate understanding of COVID-19 and contribute to finding new solutions.<br>• Utilization of the NCSR “Demokritos” Social Web Observatory for social science to study and analyze dissemination of COVID-19 information in the community (social media and news broadcasts). The analysis results will be made public to allow a real-time assessment of the confinement measures impact and to support policy planning.<br>Materials for protective equipment<br>• Providing fully available high-granularity infrastructure for measurement and recording of aerosol particles containing the virus, by size and concentration. This unit has been tested and can provide results for characterization of semi-permeable materials (e.g. masks) with sufficient respirability for human use in terms of their filtration capacity of micro- and nano-particles potentially carrying the virus. Performance of common materials has already been evaluated in comparison to standard-specification masks (Ν95, FFP1, 2, 3).<br>Air Quality<br>• Data from research stations monitoring atmospheric parameters are also examined and analyzed to assess changes in air quality as a result of the escalating restrictions on movement and decrease of related economic activities.<br><br>FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-HELLAS (FORTH)<br><br>FORTH / INSTITUTE OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY (IMBB):<br>• The Heraklion-based IMBB provides appropriate equipment and infrastructures for SARS-CoV-2 detection, applying reliable molecular virus identification methods (RT-PCR) with a potential for wide diagnostic use.<br>• MINOTECH, the IMBB in-house production facility, is already producing molecular biology consumables (Taq polymerase, Reverse Transcriptase) used for RT/RQPCR, available throughout Greece and abroad (a MINOTECH and FORTH spin-off Enzyquest collaboration).<br>• Researchers at IMBB have been developing, modelling and using an innovative methodology for molecular identification of the virus based on biosensors, which could be used in near-patient points of care (e.g. mobile medical units, airports, ports, private medical practices, etc.). It is an adaptable and efficient method, unique on a global scale, which will be exploited by the newly established FORTH spin-off BIOPIX. Evaluation of its accuracy and reliability is under way in collaboration with COVID-19 reference centres.<br>• Using its state-of-the-art genomic analysis infrastructures (FORTH is a hub of the Hellenic Networks of Precision/Personalized Medicine and operates the only laboratory for ancient DNA analysis in Greece), IMBB is able to fully analyze the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, in order to map and trace the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Greece. Obtaining this information will be extremely helpful also for characterization of the different virus types present on the Greek territory, as well as determination of their geographical origin. <br>In a recent study (Population genomics insights into the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2), researchers from IMBB and ICS/FORTH used population genetics analysis to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Their results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, they  find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, they infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts.  In addition, they estimated the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and they demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Development of information material and innovative educational projects using Augmented Reality technology, destined for workers in various posts and for volunteers to be involved in providing COVID-19-related services. <br><br>NATIONAL OBSERVATORY OF ATHENS (NOA)<br>The National Observatory of Athens, in an effort to support State authorities in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, has been developing and providing services ensuring continuous monitoring of the spatial distribution of confirmed cases and deaths, both in Greece and on a global level. Furthermore, it has been designing a number of experiments and surveys on the related atmospheric and weather conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of confinement measures on research areas of NOA competence, that is air pollution, air permeability, measurement of actual seismic background noise (without contribution from human activities), etc. Below we present the services introduced and the experiments and surveys under way, some of which have already yielded results, announced below (to be followed by specific Press releases with detailed results), while others are still underway and have yet to yield results. <br>A. Services:<br>• Information platform for continuous monitoring of worldwide COVID-19 status, with spatial granularity. A system of timely information and assessment with regard to virus spread was developed by the Operational Unit of Earth Observation and Satellite Remote Sensing Sciences under the BEYOND project, hosted at the NOA Institute of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing (IAASARS) and is freely available online. Specifically for Greece, it supports collection of data from municipalities and registry offices, and presents additional data collected by BEYOND/Hellenic National Sentinel Data Mirror Site, including socioeconomic, environmental and atmospheric parameters. <br>• Β. Experiments which are underway and have already yielded initial results:<br>• Study on the “profile” of pollution sources during confinement to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The ΝΟΑ team studying air pollution in urban areas has been surveying the common pollutant and greenhouse gas emission data and has found that a 30-50% car-use reduction by the majority of the population due to confinement measures has resulted in significant decreases of CO, NOx, PM and CO2 emissions by up to 40%. Also, due to stay-at-home orders (#menoumespiti), domestic heating is now used for longer hours with the heating profile of weekdays now resembling that of weekends. It was found that oil remains the predominant heating option in all regions of Greece, but differences between regions were observed as regards the second most used option. In Attica, use of air-conditioners is very common but in all other regions their use is roughly the same as biomass combustion.<br>• Monitoring of atmospheric permeability and visibility due to reduction of anthropogenic pollutants. The Institute for Environmental Research and Sustainable Development (IERSD) monitors on a continuous basis data directly related to particulate matter (aerosol) concentrations in the atmosphere from both anthropogenic (pollution) or natural (pollen, dust transfers) sources, as well as humidity levels. Initial results regarding visibility levels for the period 1/3/2020-10/4/2020 and their comparison with average values in multi-year visibility time series (for the same time of year and after subtracting rainy days) reveal a significant increase in atmospheric clarity and transparency. To cite just one example, visibility over 10 km has been observed 3.5 times more often than the expected average at this time of year.<br>• Study of the imprint of movement restriction measures on seismic background noise. The NOA Institute of Geodynamics (IG), in collaboration with the University of Patras, has launched a wide survey on seismic background noise, examining frequency data in the range of 5-25Hz from the 24-hour seismic activity recordings by the Hellenic Unified Seismological Network (HUSN) stations. Significantly, to this day observations reveal a noticeable gradual reduction in seismic background noise, which began immediately after the first announcement of confinement measures on March 13th, 2020 (shutdown of eating and drinking establishments, entertainment and recreational areas, malls, etc.), following closure of all schools and universities in the country on March 11th. Levels of seismic noise continued to decrease after the first announcement of measures, to ultimately record even lower values immediately after the second announcement imposing a general nation-wide lockdown as of March 23rd.<br>C. Experiments which are underway but have yet to yield results:<br>• Study of the possible influence of weather conditions on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The IERSD METEO Operational Unit has launched a large survey using machine-learning techniques to reveal and quantify possible correlations between epidemiological variables (number of confirmed cases and deaths) and meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, sunshine duration, etc.), taking also into account the impact of social distancing measures. The results will be used to measure the relative impact for each one of the examined meteorological variables on spread of COVID-19 disease.<br>• Monitoring of air pollution variation in the Attica Basin. In the context of monitoring the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic, the IERSD Atmospheric Physics and Chemistry Group (<a href="http://apcg.meteo.noa.gr/" target="_blank">http://apcg.meteo.noa.gr/</a>) monitors variation of air pollution in the Attica Basin, by conducting specialized measurements, at the NOA monitoring station in Thission, of common and specific pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (ΝΟ, ΝΟ2, ΝΟx), black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as well as of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in urban settings – a first for Greece. Furthermore, fluctuations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in major Greek cities are also monitored using data from the European Space Agency (ESA) new-generation Sentinel-5P satellite.<br>• Monitoring of atmospheric parameters by the NOA PANhellenic Geophysical observatory of Antikythera (PANGEA) to assess impact of COVID-19. The IERSD ground-based remote sensing team, in collaboration with European Research Infrastructure ACTRIS (Aerosol Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure), is participating in a pan-European project designed to collect atmospheric composition measurements, particularly regarding the vertical distribution of atmospheric parameters (aerosols, clouds, humidity), scheduled to take place from April 20 to the end of May 2020. The project aims at studying the influence of decreased anthropogenic activity (e.g. vehicle use, industrial activities, air flights). Measurements are collected at the novel NOA research infrastructure, the PANhellenic Geophysical observatory of Antikythera (PANGEA).<br><br>ATHENA RESEARCH AND INNOVATION CENTER IN INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND KNOWLEDGE TECHNOLOGIES<br>• Special version of BIP!

      <td>A new project, lead by Italian industries, universities and research infrastructures, has been promoted and funded by the European Commission. The EXSCALATE4CoV (E4CoV) project aims to exploit the most powerful computing resources currently based in Europe to empower smart in-silico drug design, while increasing the accuracy and predictability of Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD). Advanced CADD, in combination with high-throughput biochemical and phenotypic screening, will allow the rapid evaluation of the results and reduce time for discovery of new drugs. E4CoV will select, through virtual screening protocols, the most promising drugs against SARS-Cov-2 from a pool of off-label drugs (&gt; 10,000 drugs). At the same time, the Dompè Tangible Chemical Database (TCDb), comprising &gt;500 billion molecules, will be screened to identify new potential drugs to be tested against Covid-19, thus enhancing the success rate of the virtual screening step. Other European participating institutions will contribute in the domains of bioinformatics (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, SIB), biochemical assays (Fraunhofer IME), phenotypic screenings (KU LEUVEN). Along with homology models, the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IIMCB) and Trieste Synchrotron will determine the crystal structure of the coronavirus functional proteins to further enhance the quality of the in-silico models and to evaluate the structural similarities with other viral proteins. The entire process will allow the rapid identification of active and safe molecules to be further tested in animal models and in clinical trials. The coupling of virtual screening with multiple high throughput biochemical and phenotypic screenings will allow the rapid identification of ‘safe in man’ off-label drugs for immediate treatment of the already infected population. Such massive virtual screening activities need a huge computational resource, therefore the activities will be supported and empowered by three of the most powerful computer centres in Europe, namely CINECA, BSC and JÜLICH. The supercomputing facilities have been extended to the other tier-0 systems in Europe, including the ENI Corporate HPC facility, and will be able to guarantee jointly the best combination of hardware architectures, the required knowledge, and the highest speed-up for the simulations. In addition, INFN (CERN Tier-1 centre) will make available their data sharing and high throughput infrastructure to facilitate products exploitation. The Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases is the eligible centre to test for the proof-of-concept in patients, and many others hospital and polyclinics in Italy and Europe confirmed their commitment to participate to this experimentation and project.</td>

The Department of Science and Innovation through the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research has successfully commissioned and finalized the physical set-up of a core situational awareness platform.  Currently, the core of the platform is health data but over time, we intend to integrated the system with other types of data to provide a more robust platform that can provide holistic decision support to the National Command Centre.  A joint CSIR and Department of Health team are hard at work in creating a range of data warehouses including the current geographic spread of the disease, current cases, health vulnerabilities, and location of health and other facilities, amongst others.  Initial visualisations have been completed and these will be continuously enhanced and improved. We thank the team which worked on this system for the efforts and commitments.  Protocols and arrangements are also being facilitated by the DSI to enable the situational awareness platform to draw in information from other sources. This includes the results of the modelling efforts of various modelling teams on a regular basis.  Initial work, led by a team at the University of Pretoria, have also started mobilizing continent-wide networks to build databases on covid-19 cases. Of particular strategic importance for the South African response effort is the situation in our neighbouring countries.  Protocols and improved management arrangements for the facility will be finalized to protect the health and wellness of the core team.  The team has also identified opportunities for accessing key data sets held by the private sector for the explicit purpose of strengthening our situational capacity capabilities. The support of our private sector partners in this regard is crucial.   The situational awareness platform is flexible and dynamic and will be improved and customized based on the prevailing decision support requirements of the National Command Centre.</td>

      <td>The Federal Council has set up a Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force, which provided science advice to the governmental and cantonal actors in charge of the crisis management. The Science Task Force consists of a group of around 70 high profile scientists working on ten topics. Based on the available scientific evidence, the Task Force provides recommendations in Policy Briefs, which are publicly available at <a href="http://www.ncsf-tf.ch" target="_blank">www.ncsf-tf.ch</a>. Mathematical Modelling is one of the Expert Groups providing actively advice to the Federal Government. Prediction models to describe the epidemic are publicly available on the Task Force website. They are regularly updated. Furthermore, the Digital Epidemiology Expert Group substantially contributes to shaping the testing-tracing-isolating-quarantining strategy. Experts from the EPFL participating in this group developed a proximity app, which should support digital tracing and keep the number of new cases low.<br><br>Research data under the SNSF Special Call and the NRP 78 &#34;Covid-19&#34; must be made available for researchers and authorities worldwide and without delay at the latest at the end of the project.<br><br>The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) has set up special registry for Covid-19 research including projects of the SNSF, Innosuisse and EU-projects with Swiss participation (<a href="http://www.snf.ch/de/fokusForschung/newsroom/Seiten/news-200518-uebersicht-schweizer-forschung-zu-covid-19.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.snf.ch/de/fokusForschung/news...</a>).<br><br>On March 24th 2020, Swiss Universities, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries appealed to all publishing houses to remove paywalls on scientific publications supporting by this way the appeal of the International Coalition of Library Consortia (ICOLC).

      <td>TUBITAK’s (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) ULAKBİM (National Academic Network and Information Center) currently provides a &#34;National Academic Network&#34; service with a capacity of 140 Gbps as the global Internet connection and European Academic Network (GEANT) connection service to Turkish researchers. In the period of combating COVID-19, researchers&#39; access to information from virtual media has become a key issue. Moreover, with the measures taken for COVID-19, our universities will continue their spring term education as distance/open/digital education, which has resulted in the need to increase internet capacities and bandwidth demands. In order to meet these needs, ULAKNET has been working with the Turkish major telecom company, Türk Telekom, to open new ports on the main backbone circuits, consisting of Ankara, Izmir and Istanbul.  In this context, the capacity of approximately 100 ULAKNET circuits has been increased by an average of 60%. Approximately 160,000 researchers and over 7 million university students;  210 different institutions and sub-units including all public universities, some private universities, National Library, Council for Higher Education benefit from this service. Until now, all the requests from universities in terms of internet capacity increase have been met.<br>Considering the distance education services provided through cloud services, a significant number of universities currently offer distance education via ULAKBulut. In this sense, a video conferencing system has been established to meet the needs of universities. Additional backbone networks such as the one in İzmir, are planned to be opened soon.</td>
