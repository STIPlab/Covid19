      <td>A new project, lead by Italian Industries, Universities and Research Infrastructures, has been promoted and funded by the EU Commission. The EXSCALATE4CoV (E4CoV) project aims to exploit the most powerful computing resources currently based in Europe to empower smart in-silico drug design, while increasing the accuracy and predictability of Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD). Advanced CADD, in combination with high-throughput biochemical and phenotypic screening, will allow the rapid evaluation of the results and reduce time for discovery of new drugs. E4CoV will select, through virtual screening protocols, the most promising drugs against SARS-Cov-2 from a pool of off-label drugs (&gt; 10,000 drugs). At the same time, the Dompè Tangible Chemical Database (TCDb), comprising &gt;500 billion molecules, will be screened to identify new potential drugs to be tested against Covid-19, thus enhancing the success rate of the virtual screening step. Other European participating institutions will contribute in the domains of bioinformatics (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, SIB), biochemical assays (Fraunhofer IME), phenotypic screenings (KU LEUVEN). Along with homology models, the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IIMCB) and Trieste Synchrotron will determine the crystal structure of the coronavirus functional proteins to further enhance the quality of the in-silico models and to evaluate the structural similarities with other viral proteins. The entire process will allow the rapid identification of active and safe molecules to be further tested in animal models and in clinical trials. The coupling of virtual screening with multiple high throughput biochemical and phenotypic screenings will allow the rapid identification of ‘safe in man’ off-label drugs for immediate treatment of the already infected population. Such massive virtual screening activities need a huge computational resource, therefore the activities will be supported and empowered by three of the most powerful computer centres in Europe, namely CINECA, BSC and JÜLICH. The supercomputing facilities has been extended to the others tier-0 systems in Europe and including also the ENI Corporate HPC facility and will be able to guarantee jointly the best combination of hardware architectures, the required knowledge, and the highest speed-up for the simulations. In addition, INFN (CERN Tier-1 centre) will make available their data sharing and high throughput infrastructure to facilitate products exploitation. The Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases is the eligible centre to test for the PoC in patients, and many others hospital and polyclinics in Italy and Europe confirmed their commitment to participate to this experimentation and project.</td>

      <td>-To contain COVID-19 outbreaks, the Korean government has established a support system for quarantine and epidemiological study using big data and ICT. As this system uses smart city technologies, which collect and process large-scale city data, the government can quickly identify and track the locations of confirmed and suspect cases to curb the spread of the virus.<br>- When MERS-CoV spread in Korea in 2015, Korea amended its Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act to allow using data exceptionally to control and prevent the spread of infectious disease while protecting privacy.  In response to COVID-19, using cloud platforms to collect and analyse data, Korea has efficiently shared information with the KCDC, local governments, telecommunications companies and credit card companies to establish a faster epidemiological investigation system.<br>- To contain the spread of the virus, Korea supported the development of applications that allow citizens to self-diagnose and civil servants to monitor the health status and locations of citizens who are under self-quarantine.<br>- Korea has effectively released a limited amount of public masks to prevent the spread of infection among citizens, and shared public information about the public masks in cooperation with private companies to solve purchase inconveniences and concerns. As a result of cooperation with private companies, the relevant application and web service were developed quickly.<br>- To support small and medium-sized enterprises in teleworking, Korea provides SMEs with subsidies for cloud service fees (2.5 billion KRW) and a smart work pilot project (300 million KRW), while providing free or discounted teleworking-related services by partnering with major Korean software companies.<br>- In response to the increasing necessity for distance learning following the spread of COVID-19, Korea provided free, zero-rating-based online education to low and middle income students in cooperation with three major telecommunications companies.<br>- Besides, various AI and data companies in Korea are actively participating to overcome the COVID-19 crisis. Representatively, companies provide GIS-based comprehensive situation map services to provide information on the spread of infection and response information. In addition, by providing AI voice-bot service, it is possible to check the health status of people showing symptoms or those who have contacted infected persons. Also, the companies provide trend information through media traffic data analysis. In addition, cloud companies are carrying out various supports to help small and medium-sized enterprises overcome the COVID-19 crisis, including support for developing COVID-19 related applications, web services, and telecommuting solutions. Healthcare companies such as Seegene, Vuno and JLK Inspection utilize AI technologies to drastically reduce the time for developing diagnostics kits and reading X-ray images. Other companies including Deargen and Arontier use AI technologies in screening for drug repositioning and identifying candidate materials for new drug, which would dramatically reduce the time for developing therapeutics.</td>
