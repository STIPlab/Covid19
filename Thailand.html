    <tr>
      <th>What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>In Thailand, the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) is established by the Royal Thai Government on 12 March 2020, chaired by the Prime Minister, to manage COVID-19 situation of the country in cooperation with all government agencies. To support research and academic data to this center, Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI) designates the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) as the Research and Knowledge Emergency Operation Center (RKEOC). RKEOC coordinate with various agencies in all sectors, especially Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health in a wide range of topics. In this way research and academic data are collected, scrutinized, analyzed and synthesized before informing the national level in view of making decisions involving COVID-19.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>At international level, NRCT has arranged constant contacts with counterpart agencies around the world, including contact with the World Organization (WHO) and national agencies on lesson learned from the report of WHO in case of the investigation of the spread of COVID-19 in China to communicate about COVID-19 to the public.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>As RKEOC, the research and scientific data or relevant information are collected and analyzed thoroughly and further formulate easy-to-understand information that are disseminated to public on daily basis. These information present update on COVID-19 situation in Thailand and aboard and also summarize a proper practice or knowledge for people in coping with COVID-19 crisis situation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>As a main funding agency in Thailand, NRCT supports specific funding scheme for R&amp;D involving COVID-19 in short-medium-and long terms. Initially, the emergency issues for the short-term R&amp;D has been supported. NRCT allocates about 250 million Baht of new funds of about 8 million US Dollars to support R&amp;D on issues such as genome sequencing, laboratory diagnostics, mathematics model, vaccine development and development of supplies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>At national level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>The meeting for specific groups, such as researchers, startups, health sector, education sector, are arranged to brainstorm, exchange research and academic data, integrate cooperation in facilities, R&amp;D and so on. In addition, specific issues such as vaccine development, alternative mask development and etc are coordinated between agencies with NRCT as a main contribution. Another issue is to support funding for researchers and startups to develop self-screening test, test kit, vaccine, application platform and etc.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>What novel approaches, if any, is your country using to address the coronavirus crisis (e.g. use of machine learning, open science initiatives boosting access and sharing of data and research results, development and use of prediction models, etc.)?</th>
      <td>There are rapid deployment of new technologies to be used in COVID-19 situation. Ministry of Public Health uses an application called “COVID Tracker” to report a number of COVID-19 patients. In addition, Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation also develop a tracking system called “DDC-care Platform” that can follow up and evaluate health of passengers from risk country who stay in Thailand.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>COVID-19 crisis may result in the shortage of instrument or facilities for R&amp;D. Closure of labs due to social distancing policy may disrupt some of the R&amp;D work. On the other hand, we foresee that there will be some major changes in STI policy as well as modification of R&amp;D objectives.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Is support of the STI system part of planned stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy?</th>

      <th>Is there anything else regarding the STI policy response to Covid-19 in your country you would like to mention?</th>
      <td>Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation has 6 measures to response to COVID-19 as follows;<br>1. Management measure in response to closure of universities during the peak crisis<br>2. Support work from home measure<br>3. Preparation and management measure for medical schools and staffs<br>4. Risk management measures using research and innovation<br>5. Funding research and innovation in relation to COVID-19<br>6. Other support<br></td>
