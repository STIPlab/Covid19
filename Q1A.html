The idea of creating this Network arose from a meeting held in early February 2020, with the aim of promoting a technical discussion of how science can help Brazil in tackling the problem of emerging viruses, especially the coronavirus. Scientists specialized in the area and representatives from the Ministry of Health participated in the debate.

In response to the pandemic, a Cabinet Committee on the federal response to the coronavirus disease was struck; it is chaired by the Prime Minister.<br><br>Canada’s Chief Science Advisor (CSA) provides and coordinates expert advice to the Prime Minister and members of Cabinet, as appropriate and as requested, on key scientific issues. In the context of COVID-19, the CSA assembled a panel of experts to assist her in providing rapid access to biomedical expertise ensuring science is available to inform national policies and decisions. <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_98013.html" target="_blank">https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/en...</a>. <br><br>The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) monitors and responds to disease outbreaks. PHAC, through Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO), advises the Government of Canada and Canadians on the steps they should take to protect their health, working in close collaboration with the chief medical officers of health in the provinces and territories.  <br><br>The Government Operations Centre (GOC) coordinates and gathers information across the national and sub-national levels of government to ensure a national picture. For emergencies that pose a risk to public health, PHAC activates the Health Portfolio Operations Centre (HPOC), which ensures effective planning and coordination of the Agency&#39;s response efforts, in collaboration with international, federal, provincial, and territorial partners. The HPOC employs an emergency response structure modelled after the international recommended practices of the Incident Management System (IMS) framework that contains a number of coordinating functions, including research and emerging science, testing, and medical countermeasures.<br><br>During a public health response, the federal, provincial and territorial governments work collaboratively to establish an overall agreed upon strategy, as per Canada’s Public Health Response Plan for Biological Events (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/emergency-preparedness/public-health-response-plan-biological-events.html" target="_blank">https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/s...</a>). Strategies may include interventions such as: developing/modifying protocols for surveillance and laboratory testing, providing recommendations for public health measures and the use of medical countermeasures, identifying research needs and developing and implementing communication strategies that allows F/P/T governments to develop harmonized communication plans and stakeholder engagement strategies.  This is facilitated through the activation of a number of governance structures, for instance:<br>o A Special Advisory Committee (SAC) on novel coronavirus, composed of the CPHO and the chief public health officers in the provinces and territories.  The SAC has the mandate to provide advice to the F/P/T Conference of Deputy Ministers of Health (CDMH). <br>o A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) reviews and approves technical products prior to them going to SAC. <br><br>In addition to public health, officials in other federal government agencies have set up regular calls with their provincial-territorial counterparts to discuss science-related issues that inform policies.  For instance, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) and the provincial government ministries responsible for science and research  discuss ways to better coordinate the provincial initiatives  with those being undertaken at the federal level.  Food safety and security issues are also being discussed among various agencies and industry. <br></td>
