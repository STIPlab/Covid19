GloPID-R is an international network of major research funding organizations with the aim to facilitate a rapid and effective response to infectious disease outbreaks. In response to the emergence of COVID-19, Members of the GloPID-R network, including RCN, immediately coordinated to identify the existing, funded research projects in this area and began launching emergency calls for funding. The RCN emergency call on COVID-19 research is published on GloPID-R website and RCN participates in ongoing coordination and information sharing activities through GloPID-R, which also includes WHO.</td>

      <td>1. Measures that have been implemented<br>The Norwegian Research Council has launched a COVID-19 Emergency Call for funding in order to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The aim is to support research that will enable us to understand and contain the new COVID-19, as well as to improve efficient patient management and public health (national and international) preparedness and response to the current and analogous outbreaks that may come in the future. The call for proposals is based on the recent research priorities defined by the WHO. International collaboration with research groups in other countries, including those funded by GLOPID-R member organisations to foster larger-scale studies, is encouraged. The scope of the proposals may include different topics, including health and economic aspects. The total budget is 2560000 EUR.<br>file:///C:/Users/KD1258/Downloads/COVID-19%20Emergency%20Call%20for%20Proposals%20Project%20Outlines%20for%20Call%20Concerning%20the%20Fight%20Against%20Coronavirus%20Disease%20(COVID-19).pdf<br><br>The Research Council also has a large portfolio of ongoing projects on issues in the fields of health, biotechnology and societal issues that may be relevant for COVID-19 as well. In addition, several research institutions and public health authorities (such as the Norwegian Institute of Public Health) conduct research that is relevant for this issue. However, we do not have a complete overview or a list of projects. <br><br>2. Measures under consideration, not yet decided <br><br>The suggested measures encompass the Research Council's project portfolio as well as the different research-performing sectors, particularly related to trade and industry and the institute sector (the independent research institutes). The measures will be discussed with the relevant ministries.<br><br>The measures suggested by the Research Council have been divided into six categories: <br>1. General measure aimed toward the institute sector (increased basic funding) <br>2. General measures aimed toward trade and industry <br>3. Measures aimed toward the direct restructuring of businesses <br>4. Digitalisation measures and competence-building for digitalisation ("kompetanseløft for digitalisering")<br>5. Measures aimed toward real-time research and research for crisis management<br>6. Other measures (the Norwegian public sector, the consequences for low-income countries) <br>In addition to these suggested measures, the Research Council wishes to implement measures related to:<br>-  funding percentage;<br>-  the research organisations' own contributions for projects that receive funding; <br>- changes to the contract period and other changes to the contract that can in part be carried out within the current funding and partly through increased public funding in order to reduce risk, as well as facilitate the situation for the most vulnerable actors in trade and industry and the institute sector.<br> <br>Furthermore, there is a need for measures aimed toward improving the situation for young researchers (PhD candidates and Postdoctoral fellows) who must stay at home to care for children, thereby being barred from using laboratories and other research infrastructure.<br><br>Most of the measures are time-limited, and the budget for the majority of the measures must be distributed across several years as this concerns multiannual centres or research projects.<br></td>

CEPI is headquartered in Oslo, Norway. At the 2017 launch, Nature said, "It is by far the largest vaccine development initiative ever against viruses that are potential epidemic threats". In March 2020, CEPI was identified as a "key player in the race to develop a vaccine" for the coronavirus. <br><br>The Norwegian government  has recently proposed app. 200 mill.
