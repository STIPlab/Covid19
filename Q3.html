      <td>● Mapping molecular biology laboratories in Colombian Universities:<br><br>The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation is leading the initiative for mapping molecular biology laboratories in Colombian universities through a survey designed by the academic sector. This instrument was a task requested by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, the Ministry of National Education and the National Institute of Health of Colombia, with the objective of mapping the capacities of the laboratories in the universities of Colombia to support the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 from the identification of the genetic markers for SARS-CoV-2.<br><br>This information will be an essential input to know which laboratories have BCL-2 biosafety standards and have documented and verified procedures for quality assurance, sample traceability and validity of results. Furthermore, the results of the survey will detect if these laboratories have methodological control and endorsement of the tests and service qualification. It is important to clarify that the survey is still in the process of completion by the universities and other entities, therefore the results are not conclusive yet.<br><br>● Program: Strengthening and provision of equipment, infrastructure and medical supplies for early detection and care of patients affected by Coronavirus in Colombia &#34;Covid-19 Colombia&#34;<br><br>This project aims to increase the conditions of care for laboratories in frontier areas and vulnerable territories in the departments of Amazonas, Cauca, Chocó, Guajira, Magdalena, Nariño, San Andrés and Vichada in the context of the campaign against COVID-19. The total budget for the project is 19,5 million dollars, with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia contributing 6,5 million dollars and seeking to leverage 13 million dollars. This project arises from the profound imbalance existing between regions in Colombia, where social gaps highlight the need to improve public health equipment and capacities in the border areas and other areas with high levels of vulnerability.<br><br>This objective will be achieved by strengthening the provision of equipment, infrastructure and medical supplies to laboratories and research centers for the early detection and care of patients possibly affected by COVID-19. The following 3 results are expected:<br><br>i) Provision of equipment for laboratories and medical staff for the testing of COVID-19.<br>ii) To design a strategy for the Social Appropriation and Dissemination of Knowledge about COVID-19.<br>iii) Support for research centers, universities and companies in R&amp;D and innovation projects against COVID-19.<br><br></td>

The planned interventions are divided into short-term fast-line research that provide an up-to-date understanding of the spread of the virus, as well as to help identify the immediate socio-economic effects. This type of research is expected to bring results within a few months. Longer-term research grants are currently being developed – these are more forward looking and will require a longer-term effort.  <br><br>Short-term needs are addressed in the framework of the RITA program (see <a href="https://www.etag.ee/en/funding/programmes/rita/" target="_blank">https://www.etag.ee/en/funding/programme...</a>) through which ETAg has launched an additional call for projects addressing COVID-19. At least two projects (worth approximately 50 000 euros each) will be co-financed (ministries will contribute with 40% of co-financing). Topics will be selected and approved by the scientific advisers of different ministries. The call is open to all R&amp;D institutions.

      <td>Please note that the response to this question is overlapping somewhat with the issues asked in question 6. We often find it difficult to make a difference between the actions and stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy in general and on the innovation system in particular.<br><br>1) The Bank of Finland made decisions on 15 March 2020 on measures aimed at alleviating payment difficulties and liquidity shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring access to funding for households and businesses, particularly SMEs. The decisions were prepared in cooperation with the Government and key authorities, and in dialogue with the financial sector. They complement the decisions taken earlier by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) to support favourable liquidity conditions and preserve the smooth provision of credit in the euro area.<br><br>The Bank of Finland assesses, in close cooperation with national, European and Nordic authorities, the stability of the financial system and, in particular, developments in financial intermediation. The purpose is to facilitate the ability of credit institutions to provide funding to businesses and households and to mitigate the negative economic impact of the pandemic. The Board of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) has started work on an immediate review of the level of capital requirements that are subject to national decision-making.<br><br>In 2009–2018, the Bank of Finland invested in the domestic corporate paper market. This investment activity was discontinued as market volumes shrank, reflecting the decrease in funding needs of businesses. Recent events have weakened the ability of markets to function and increased the funding needs of businesses. The Bank of Finland has therefore decided to restart its activities in the domestic corporate paper markets. The size of the programme was initially EUR 500 million. A few days later, the size of the programme was increased to EUR 1 billion due to huge demand.<br><br>For more, see:<br><a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/media-and-publications/releases/2020/the-bank-of-finland-decided-on-new-measures-to-safeguard-funding-for-businesses-and-households-during-the-corona-virus-pandemic/" target="_blank">https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/media-and...</a><br><br>2) The Tax Administration will ease the terms of payment arrangements for the time being. If a company has difficulties paying taxes due to the coronavirus situation, it can request a payment arrangement with eased terms starting 25 March 2020. For example, according to the new terms, the first installment of the payment arrangement will fall due in three months after the arrangement has become active, as opposed to just one month.<br><br>See: <a href="https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/newsroom/corona-situation/" target="_blank">https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/newsroom...</a><br><br>3) The Government decided on 20 March on an extensive package to support companies and to alleviate the negative effects of the coronavirus epidemic (See press release: <a href="https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/hallitukselta-mittava-paketti-yritysten-tueksi-finnveran-kautta-10-miljardin-euron-lisarahoitus-yrityksille" target="_blank">https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publis...</a>). <br><br>Organisations operating in the field of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE Group) monitor the effects of the coronavirus on businesses, employment, consumers and security of supply. The Ministry together with other organisations in the MEAE Group, monitors the effects of the coronavirus on business activities, employment and security of supply, and takes the necessary measures to alleviate the negative impacts.

These services are intended for SMEs and midcaps operating in Finland whose business is suffering from the coronavirus situation. Financial services are intended for at least tourism and auxiliary tourism services, creative and performing industries and all sectors where subcontracting chains are affected. The funding is intended for companies to explore and tap into new business opportunities in emergency conditions. The first funding decisions were made immediately on 20 March 2020.<br><br>3.2) Finnvera (<a href="https://www.finnvera.fi/eng/" target="_blank">https://www.finnvera.fi/eng/</a>)<br>The Government will make additional financing of EUR 10 billion available to businesses through Finnvera. The principal operating model is offering guarantees to banks that grant loans. In addition, the state will increase its coverage of Finnvera’s credit and guarantee losses from 50% to 80%.<br><br>3.3) ELY Centres (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) (<a href="https://www.ely-keskus.fi/en/web/ely-en/" target="_blank">https://www.ely-keskus.fi/en/web/ely-en/...</a>)<br>ELY Centres’ grant authorisations for business development projects will be increased by EUR 50 million. The additional authorisation will be used to support SMEs particularly in the service sector but also in other sectors as necessary to manage and prevent the effects of the coronavirus.<br><br>3.4) VTT – Technical Research Center (<a href="https://www.vttresearch.com/en" target="_blank">https://www.vttresearch.com/en</a>)<br>VTT is responding to corona virus in various ways, including the following: <br><br>3.4.1 Responding to customer needs in exceptional circumstances<br>Through active and continuous communication, VTT enables the understanding of customer needs even in exceptional circumstances. All customer meetings have been converted to online meetings. Plans to help clients monitor the progress of their daily experimental work at VTT, for example, have been developed and are being implemented. VTT&#39;s new, streamlined website has been launched. In addition, social media and other digital marketing channels are actively used for communication. As an example, VTT utilizes webinars and recordings of VTT researchers&#39; presentations to enable scientific exchange despite the prevailing conditions.<br><br>3.4.2 Immediate RTD actions to assist Finnish society during covid-19<br>During the Corona pandemic, VTT sees opportunities to participate in a joint national effort by leveraging the organization&#39;s expertise and available infrastructure. VTT has identified capabilities that would provide immediate national support for the Corona effort, as well as expertise that will bring significant benefits over the next year. Recognized examples include some with immediate effect, some requiring more time and also additional investments.<br><br>3.4.3 Measures to mitigate the economic shock and support national competitiveness<br>VTT has started planning how VTT&#39;s research resources can be harnessed to maintain Finland&#39;s competitiveness in this exceptional situation. As client assignments fade, VTT&#39;s freed up researcher resources can be utilized (subject to an increase in state aid) for strategic themes and projects that benefit Finnish industry and society and revitalize economic growth. VTT has the capability to launch such research projects quickly. The themes will not only address the challenges posed by the corona situation in terms of industrial competitiveness and security of supply, but will also continue to focus on providing solutions to the long-term challenges of carbon neutrality and the circular economy. Innovations related to these themes will also benefit Finland after the immediate corona crisis eased.<br></td>

      <td>1) Testing for the virus is done by the Hellenic Pasteur Institute (<a href="https://www.pasteur.gr" target="_blank">https://www.pasteur.gr</a>), the national COVid-19 Reference Centre. Testing is up until now limited to those with serious symptoms. It is not possible to extend testing to the symptom-free population, mainly due to shortages in reagents and essential consumables. Epidemiological data are stored for all samples. However, it is still early days for concrete epidemiological studies. <br><br>2) Several Greek public Research Centers and Universities have joined forces to contribute to the national effort to broaden testing of the population under an initiative of the National Council for Research &amp; Innovation and the National Public Health Organization. This plan has not been fully implemented yet until all biosafety requirements are met and all controls are completed. As a first phase, the plan includes the Laboratory of Hygiene and Epidemiology of the University of Athens (<a href="https://dehems.med.uoa.gr" target="_blank">https://dehems.med.uoa.gr</a>), the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens (<a href="https://www.bioacademy.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.bioacademy.gr/</a>) and the Institute of Applied Biosciences at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (<a href="https://www.inab.certh.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.inab.certh.gr/</a>). Further research entities are also appropriately equipped in order to detect SARS-COV-2 by real time PCR, such as, for example, the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH) (<a href="https://www.imbb.forth.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.imbb.forth.gr/</a>). The latter has also developed an innovative technology based on biosensors for the direct detection of virus particles of SARS-COV-2. They are in consultation with the Reference Centre of the Pasteur Institute in order to perform tests. A spin-off company has been created by FORTH for the next steps and exploitation of research results. <br><br>3) There are important research activities in the field of biology of viruses (among them the family of coronaviruses) along with the reaction of the human immune system to viral infections. Such research is mostly undertaken at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology / FORTH, but also at the other biomedical research Institutes. Substantial work is also being done in the field of epidemiological modelling of the virus spread dynamics with mathematical and computer models. <br><br>4) On treatment for COVID-19, Greece is already implementing a strategy of drug-repositioning / re-purposing for already approved drugs. Several research groups along with enterprises are working in this field.<br></td>
