      <td>The Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications of Brazil (MCTIC) established an advisory committee and strategic plan to provide coordinated and quick responses to emerging viruses. This &#34;Virus-MCTIC Network&#34; coordinates the efforts of research laboratories with a view to identifying complementarities of infrastructure and activities in the ongoing research on Covid-19, influenza and others. The objectives of the network are the integration of scientific research and development efforts in the area of emerging viruses; definition of research priorities; coordination of ongoing R,D&amp;I initiatives related to emerging viruses; and development of technologies to assist the country in facing those challenges. Researchers and representatives of MCTIC, the Ministry of Health and development agencies participate in the initiative.  <br><br>As an example, within this network, the National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM) is already employing tools like computational biology and AI to evaluate the effectiveness of about 2 thousand existing drugs against Covid-19. Computational data tests use atomic structure data and the behavior of Covid-19 proteins to examine the interaction of molecules of available medications with these target proteins, and to pre-select those that show promise in interfering with the infection. Selected molecules will then be tested in vitro to verify its effectiveness in eliminating the virus, which will allow the new use of already available medications. <br><br>The emergency release of R$ 3.4 billion (around USD 700 million) to be used in initiatives to fight the pandemic has recently been approved by the Federal government. The funds will be allocated to the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Defense; and Ministry of Citizenship.From that amount, R$ 100 million (around USD 20 million) will be directed to STI measures, from the National Scientific and Technological Development Fund (FNDCT), to be applied in Research Networks, National Institutes of Science and Technology (INCT) and public calls via the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Funding for Studies and Projects Agency (Finep) <br><br>The funds will be used for emergency support of projects (grants) within the scope of the priorities defined by the Virus-MCTIC Network, including: - Development of diagnostic kits; - Development of vaccines; - Use of advanced technologies for rapid selection of possible drugs; - Large-scale sequencing and monitoring of mutations in SARS-Cov 2 (COVID-19) samples; - Structuring a virus sample bank for scientific studies to understand the disease. <br><br>The State National Postal Service Company (Correios) is acting as the logistics partner for the Virus-MCTIC Network, being responsible for collecting viral material (new coronavirus and influenza) from selected laboratories and delivering them to other labs (in-kind contribution). These are being used in studies on contagion, proliferation of viruses and vaccines for diseases. Scientists working on the matter now have priority in receiving and sending research material, since time is crucial for the effectiveness of research with COVID-19. <br><br>A research call for projects has already been launched on the total of R$ 50 million (around USD 10 million) by CNPq. The call is aimed at projects on diagnosis, vaccines, clinical trials and other research related to the virus. Overall priority is given to the development of a) medications and respective pre-clinical and clinical tests; b) vaccines and respective pre-clinical and clinical tests; c) innovation for the production in large scale of ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) and their related systems; Research, development and innovation in diagnostic tests are also a priority; monitoring and sequencing the virus genome circulating in the country; telemedicine tools.  <br><br>The Ministry of Health has authorized the use of telemedicine to care for patients with coronavirus (March 23rd, 2020). To this end, the MCTIC will carry out: I - direct contracting of projects, studies, technologies and innovations; II - public call (s) for contracting projects, studies, technologies and innovations; and III - coordination between organizations in the science, technology, innovation and communications system. <br><br>MCTIC has also launched 7 orders for technology acquisition on the total amount of R$ 50 million (around USD 10 million). They include development of products for genetic sequencing, clinical trials protocol, the application of AI on inhibiting virus replication, development of test kits and vaccines as well as social projects. <br><br>Another initiative by MCTIC is the launch of the platform IdearuMCTIC (<a href="http://www.mctic.gov.br" target="_blank">www.mctic.gov.br</a>), aimed at connecting ideas and evaluating the maturity of technological solutions related to the challenges imposed by the pandemic. <br><br>Besides that, funding State agencies such as FAPESP (State of São Paulo), Fundação Araucária (State of Paraná) and FAPERJ (State of Rio de Janeiro), as well as funding federal agencies such as CAPES (Ministry of Education), are releasing funds for research on tackling the challenges caused by the pandemic, such as the development of tests or vaccines, as well as the genomic sequencing of the virus. Other entities like EMBRAPII (Brazilian Industrial Research and Innovation Company), SEBRAE (Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Agency), and Porto Digital (Science park located at the State of Pernambuco) are taking efforts for innovative solutions to be developed, such as the fabrication of ventilators and of tests for diagnosis of COVID-19. <br><br>The São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) launched a call for research proposals on COVID-19 within the time limit of 24 months, with a view to understanding the virus` epidemiological characteristics, developing tests and therapies, conducting research on clinical procedures, identifying and evaluating innate immune responses and issues related to the social behavior of the affected population. The total amount of the research call is R$ 10 million (around USD 2 million). <br><br>FAPESP and FINEP, under the PIPE/PAPPE Grant Program, launched a call for research projects on the development of technologies for products, services and processes to fight Covid-19. The research call will allow that participants from previous phases of the Grant program (Phase 1 or Phase 2) to commercialize emergency products or services.  <br><br>Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Agency (SEBRAE) will assign R$ 2 million (around USD 400 thousand) to the development of technological solutions by startups and other small and medium-sized enterprises with a view to help the Brazil face Covid-19. The funds will add up to R$ 4 million (around USD 800 thousand) from the Brazilian Industrial Research and Innovation Company (EMBRAPII) and contributions by participating companies and accredited research and innovation centers. Joint resources are expected to reach the total of R$ 10 million (around USD 2 million). The resources may be used for software development, system devices, hardware, medical parts and equipment, and others. <br><br>EMBRAPII has also approved R$ 2.3 million (USD 900 thousand) to the development of mechanical ventilators, that provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide directly from the blood.  <br><br>The National Service for Industrial Training (SENAI), through the &#34;Innovation Call for Industry&#34;, will select projects that help prevent, diagnose and treat Covid-19. It foresees the destination of R$ 10 million (around USD 2 million) for proposals on solutions against problems caused by the virus, with immediate application and results within 40 days, in the areas of consulting, metrology, testing, analysis, research, development and innovation. Examples of these solutions are the manufacture of mechanical respirators and the development of rapid tests for the detection the disease. <br><br>The National Council of State Foundations of Research Support (CONFAP) released a proposal for Brazilian institutions to join the so-called &#34;Development of therapy and diagnosis for fighting coronavirus infections&#34; launched by `Innovative Medicines Initiative`, in cooperation with European Union and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). Its objective is to identify new therapeutic agents, early diagnostic systems, and reliable data related to Covid-19. Brazilian partners can participate in a co-financing scheme. The European side plans to disburse EUR 45 million. <br><br>The University of São Paulo (USP) is conducting researches for vaccine development with a quick response against the virus. The work takes advantage of results from previous studies on other types of coronaviruses, which, hopefully, can help in the case of Covid-19. Brazilian research is comparatively safer, as it is based on the creation of a particle similar to coronavirus, the VLP (virus-like particle), equivalent to a hollow virus, without the genetic material and therefore without the transmissibility of the disease.  <br><br>The Covid Challenge 19 is an initiative by the Public Persecutor`s Office of the State of Pernambuco (MPPE), the State Health Secretariat of Pernambuco (SES-PE) and Porto Digital. The MPPE and SES-PE offer R$ 1.3 million for innovative and high-impact solutions that can be adopted in a short term, with a view to fighting the virus. The challenge already includes the submission of 543 ideas on 5 areas: a) monitoring the risk groups; b) information flow management; c) monitoring social isolation; d) support for health agents; and e) testing and diagnosis. <br></td>

The deadline for submission was 12 February 2020. Ninety one proposals were received. The initially allocated budget of €10 million was subsequently increased to €47.5 million given the scale of the outbreak and the quality and potential of the research proposals submitted. Such rapid action was possible thanks to the standing budget line for public health emergency research funds included in the annual Work Programmes for health research of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. Following the evaluation of proposals on 25-26 February 2020, 17 research projects were shortlisted for funding. Collectively, they cover comprehensively the wide range of research questions related to this novel virus and the disease it causes. Research foci include the virus and disease dynamics, the development of rapid diagnostics, the exploration of different avenues for the development of therapeutics, and vaccine development.<br>- In addition, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private partnership between the EU and the pharmaceutical industry (through its association EFPIA), announced on 3 March 2020 a special fast track call for proposals for research projects. The projects should focus primarily on developing treatments and diagnostics to tackle better the current COVID-19 outbreak and increase preparedness for potential future outbreaks. The European Commission funds IMI through Horizon 2020 and will contribute up to €45 million to this call. A commitment of a similar scale is expected from the pharmaceutical industry so that the total investment could reach up to €90 million.  <br>- Another partnership supported by Horizon 2020, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials (public-public) Partnership (EDCTP2), which focuses on infectious diseases research in sub-Saharan Africa, also has a standing budget line to address public health emergencies and is likewise preparing to launch a call for expressions of interest for research projects to address the pandemic.<br>- The European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator pilot called on start-up companies and SMEs with technologies and innovations that could assist in the treatment of, testing for, monitoring of, or other aspects of the Corona virus outbreak.<br>- On 16 March, the Commission offered up to €80 million of financial support to CureVac, a highly innovative vaccine developer from Tübingen, Germany, to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the Coronavirus in Europe. The support would come in the form of an EU guarantee of a currently assessed EIB loan of an identical amount, in the framework of the InnovFin Infectious Disease Finance Facility under Horizon 2020.<br><br>(ii) Reorienting already on-going research<br>Over the course of the past few years, substantial investments have been made via Horizon 2020 in research preparedness projects, specifically in anticipation of this type of public health emergency; these research projects have early on (January) been mobilised to the maximum extent for the COVID-19 response. <br>- The project “PREPARE” (EU grant of €24 million) supports the research readiness of primary care providers and hospitals through a large network in 42 European countries. The project is currently in highest-level response mode, which implies the initiation and implementation of clinical research studies on SARS-CoV-2 across Europe.<br>- The project “European Virus Archive Global” (EU grant of €12.2 million) coordinates a virtual collection of viruses, to be used for e.g. diagnostic purposes; it has already responded to more than 1200 requests, providing access to the necessary material for diagnosing Corona virus infection. <br>- Other projects such as “VEO” (on diagnostics and data mining) or “MOOD” (on data mining and epidemic modelling) have only just started (on 1 January 2020) but have immediately refocused on the COVID-19 response.<br>- Finally, targeted exercises are ongoing to screen currently funded projects on potentially relevant activities, e.g. innovations in the fields of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, specialised isolation units for infected patients, tracking human mobility during epidemics, filtration technology to remove viral material, etc. that may be in the pipeline.<br><br>(iii) Speeding up research and achieving tangible societal impact by optimising enabling framework condition<br>- As for data sharing, the newly funded projects will need an infrastructure enabling them to share their data. Discussions have started with the currently funded “RECODID” project (one of its partners being EMBL) to explore how this project can facilitate and provide a common platform for data sharing. We aim for this platform to link with different European research infrastructures (EMBL being one example), to become part of the European Open Science Cloud, and to contribute to the future European Health Data Space.<br>- More broadly, the European Commission already has an open access mandate for publications with an embargo of 6 months allowed for STEM disciplines. The European Commission has signed the Statement on Data Sharing in Public Health Emergency along with other funders and institutions across the world in March 2020 for immediate open access to publications and data that advance the research on COVID-19. The European Commission will also provide guidelines recommending to researchers to practice immediate open access to their publications beyond what is formally asked of them, in view of addressing this crisis. <br><br>(iv) Drawing up an R&amp;I Action Plan within the ERA framework<br>The purpose of this R&amp;I action plan will be to identify first priority R&amp;I work streams for coordinated action between the Commission and the Member States taking action against the Corona virus that can be executed in the next weeks.  It will be a living document and will be updated regularly with additional R&amp;I coordinated actions. It will comprehend aspects linked to creating the ‘framework’ conditions for researchers such as access to data and to research infrastructures, and the coordination of clinical trials, as well as funding opportunities for researchers in different formats, and in a coordinated way.<br></td>

We often find it difficult to make a difference between the actions and stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy in general and on the innovation system in particular.<br><br>1) The Bank of Finland made decisions on 15 March 2020 on measures aimed at alleviating payment difficulties and liquidity shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring access to funding for households and businesses, particularly SMEs. The decisions were prepared in cooperation with the Government and key authorities, and in dialogue with the financial sector. They complement the decisions taken earlier by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) to support favourable liquidity conditions and preserve the smooth provision of credit in the euro area.<br><br>The Bank of Finland assesses, in close cooperation with national, European and Nordic authorities, the stability of the financial system and, in particular, developments in financial intermediation. The purpose is to facilitate the ability of credit institutions to provide funding to businesses and households and to mitigate the negative economic impact of the pandemic. The Board of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) has started work on an immediate review of the level of capital requirements that are subject to national decision-making.<br><br>In 2009–2018, the Bank of Finland invested in the domestic corporate paper market. This investment activity was discontinued as market volumes shrank, reflecting the decrease in funding needs of businesses. Recent events have weakened the ability of markets to function and increased the funding needs of businesses. The Bank of Finland has therefore decided to restart its activities in the domestic corporate paper markets. The size of the programme was initially EUR 500 million. A few days later, the size of the programme was increased to EUR 1 billion due to huge demand.<br><br>For more, see:<br><a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/media-and-publications/releases/2020/the-bank-of-finland-decided-on-new-measures-to-safeguard-funding-for-businesses-and-households-during-the-corona-virus-pandemic/" target="_blank">https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/media-and...</a><br><br>2) The Tax Administration will ease the terms of payment arrangements for the time being. If a company has difficulties paying taxes due to the coronavirus situation, it can request a payment arrangement with eased terms starting 25 March 2020. For example, according to the new terms, the first installment of the payment arrangement will fall due in three months after the arrangement has become active, as opposed to just one month.<br><br>See: <a href="https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/newsroom/corona-situation/" target="_blank">https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/newsroom...</a><br><br>3) The Government decided on 20 March on an extensive package to support companies and to alleviate the negative effects of the coronavirus epidemic (See press release: <a href="https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/hallitukselta-mittava-paketti-yritysten-tueksi-finnveran-kautta-10-miljardin-euron-lisarahoitus-yrityksille" target="_blank">https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publis...</a>). <br><br>Organisations operating in the field of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE Group) monitor the effects of the coronavirus on businesses, employment, consumers and security of supply. The Ministry together with other organisations in the MEAE Group, monitors the effects of the coronavirus on business activities, employment and security of supply, and takes the necessary measures to alleviate the negative impacts. All the relevant general information about the coronavirus and the authorities’ actions and responses can be found from the following website: <a href="https://tem.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus" target="_blank">https://tem.fi/en/information-on-coronav...</a><br><br>In the field of STI, it includes the following: <br><br>3.1) Business Finland (<a href="https://www.businessfinland.fi/en/for-finnish-customers/home/" target="_blank">https://www.businessfinland.fi/en/for-fi...</a>)<br>Business Finland’s grant authorisations will be increased by EUR 150 million to permit immediate business support measures.<br>On 19 March 2020, Business Finland launched two new financial services to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic. These services are intended for SMEs and midcaps operating in Finland whose business is suffering from the coronavirus situation. Financial services are intended for at least tourism and auxiliary tourism services, creative and performing industries and all sectors where subcontracting chains are affected. The funding is intended for companies to explore and tap into new business opportunities in emergency conditions. The first funding decisions were made immediately on 20 March 2020.<br><br>3.2) Finnvera (<a href="https://www.finnvera.fi/eng/" target="_blank">https://www.finnvera.fi/eng/</a>)<br>The Government will make additional financing of EUR 10 billion available to businesses through Finnvera. The principal operating model is offering guarantees to banks that grant loans. In addition, the state will increase its coverage of Finnvera’s credit and guarantee losses from 50% to 80%.<br><br>3.3) ELY Centres (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) (<a href="https://www.ely-keskus.fi/en/web/ely-en/" target="_blank">https://www.ely-keskus.fi/en/web/ely-en/...</a>)<br>ELY Centres’ grant authorisations for business development projects will be increased by EUR 50 million. The additional authorisation will be used to support SMEs particularly in the service sector but also in other sectors as necessary to manage and prevent the effects of the coronavirus.<br><br>3.4) VTT – Technical Research Center (<a href="https://www.vttresearch.com/en" target="_blank">https://www.vttresearch.com/en</a>)<br>VTT is responding to corona virus in various ways, including the following: <br><br>3.4.1 Responding to customer needs in exceptional circumstances<br>Through active and continuous communication, VTT enables the understanding of customer needs even in exceptional circumstances. All customer meetings have been converted to online meetings. Plans to help clients monitor the progress of their daily experimental work at VTT, for example, have been developed and are being implemented. VTT&#39;s new, streamlined website has been launched. In addition, social media and other digital marketing channels are actively used for communication. As an example, VTT utilizes webinars and recordings of VTT researchers&#39; presentations to enable scientific exchange despite the prevailing conditions.<br><br>3.4.2 Immediate RTD actions to assist Finnish society during covid-19<br>During the Corona pandemic, VTT sees opportunities to participate in a joint national effort by leveraging the organization&#39;s expertise and available infrastructure. VTT has identified capabilities that would provide immediate national support for the Corona effort, as well as expertise that will bring significant benefits over the next year. Recognized examples include some with immediate effect, some requiring more time and also additional investments.<br><br>3.4.3 Measures to mitigate the economic shock and support national competitiveness<br>VTT has started planning how VTT&#39;s research resources can be harnessed to maintain Finland&#39;s competitiveness in this exceptional situation. As client assignments fade, VTT&#39;s freed up researcher resources can be utilized (subject to an increase in state aid) for strategic themes and projects that benefit Finnish industry and society and revitalize economic growth. VTT has the capability to launch such research projects quickly. The themes will not only address the challenges posed by the corona situation in terms of industrial competitiveness and security of supply, but will also continue to focus on providing solutions to the long-term challenges of carbon neutrality and the circular economy. Innovations related to these themes will also benefit Finland after the immediate corona crisis eased.<br></td>

Given the global spread of the virus and the possible shortage of reagents, will Greece be able to respond successfully to the increased demand for virus detection tests as well as antibody tests, particularly as containment measures are gradually lifted? <br>2. Despite identification of high-risk groups (seniors and people with underlying conditions), predictability of outcome for individual patients remains relatively low. Are there factors like genetic susceptibility which could help in this regard? <br>3. Which are the transmission patterns of the virus and which are the predominant virus strains among the Greek population? <br>4. Which will be the immunity levels of the population and of each patient after the pandemic? <br><br>The Action will be implemented by four (4) higher education institutions and six (6) research centres. Greek research centres and university laboratories, working together with the medical community, have the privilege to be ideally positioned, at international level, to conduct this study, which is expected not only to have a direct impact within Greece in the immediate future, but also to put Greece at the vanguard of global advances in understanding and tackling SARS-CoV-2.<br><br>The Flagship Research Action has a pubic budget of € 2.475 m under National Public  Investments Programme.<br><br>More detailed information about the Flagship Action is given in the following link:<br>gsrt.gr/central.aspx?sId=124I458I1163I323I509672&amp;olID=777&amp;neID=589&amp;neTa=1_122365&amp;ncID=0&amp;neHC=0&amp;tbid=0&amp;lrID=2&amp;oldUIID=aI777I0I119I428I1089I0I3&amp;actionID=load<br><br>Further initiatives undertaken by Greek Research organizations are as follows:<br><br>1) Testing for the virus is done by the Hellenic Pasteur Institute (<a href="https://www.pasteur.gr" target="_blank">https://www.pasteur.gr</a>), the national COVid-19 Reference Centre. Testing is up until now limited to those with serious symptoms. It is not possible to extend testing to the symptom-free population, mainly due to shortages in reagents and essential consumables. Epidemiological data are stored for all samples. However, it is still early days for concrete epidemiological studies. <br><br>2) Several Greek public Research Centers and Universities have joined forces to contribute to the national effort to broaden testing of the population under an initiative of the National Council for Research &amp; Innovation and the National Public Health Organization. This plan has not been fully implemented yet until all biosafety requirements are met and all controls are completed. As a first phase, the plan includes the Laboratory of Hygiene and Epidemiology of the University of Athens (<a href="https://dehems.med.uoa.gr" target="_blank">https://dehems.med.uoa.gr</a>), the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens (<a href="https://www.bioacademy.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.bioacademy.gr/</a>) and the Institute of Applied Biosciences at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (<a href="https://www.inab.certh.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.inab.certh.gr/</a>). Further research entities are also appropriately equipped in order to detect SARS-COV-2 by real time PCR, such as, for example, the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH) (<a href="https://www.imbb.forth.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.imbb.forth.gr/</a>). The latter has also developed an innovative technology based on biosensors for the direct detection of virus particles of SARS-COV-2. They are in consultation with the Reference Centre of the Pasteur Institute in order to perform tests. A spin-off company has been created by FORTH for the next steps and exploitation of research results. <br><br>3) There are important research activities in the field of biology of viruses (among them the family of coronaviruses) along with the reaction of the human immune system to viral infections. Such research is mostly undertaken at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology / FORTH, but also at the other biomedical research Institutes. Substantial work is also being done in the field of epidemiological modelling of the virus spread dynamics with mathematical and computer models. <br><br>4) On treatment for COVID-19, Greece is already implementing a strategy of drug-repositioning / re-purposing for already approved drugs. Several research groups along with enterprises are working in this field.<br></td>

Moreover, the tax authorities will temporarily decrease the recovery interest rate from 4% to 0.01%. <br>5. The so-called GO-regulation, through which SMEs can secure a 50% guarantee from the government on their bank loans and bank guarantees, will be expanded. The maximum ceiling guaranteed will be increased from EUR 400 million tot EUR 1.5 billion and the maximum GO-facility per firm will be increased from EUR 50 million to EUR 150 million. This will enable both small and large  firms to benefit from this policy.<br>6. In order to support small firms and start-ups with little financial reserves, we will expand the Qredits-programme. Through this program, we expect to support approximately 3000 to 6000 firms by a deferment of payment for a period of a maximum of six months and by giving those firms a discount on their rent payments for the same period. <br>7. Agricultural and horticultural SMEs will be supported by temporarily relaxing the guarantee for working capital, which is part of the existing decree Borgstelling MKB-Landbouwkredieten (BL). The decree will ease acute liquidity problems for agricultural and horticultural business who experience those problems due to the COVID-situation. The credit is for a maximum of 2 years.<br>8. Repayments of Innovation Credit and Early Stage Financing, both subsidies in the form of a credit, can be delayed for six monthts. <br>9. Likely, the Dutch Health ministry will do additional investments, together with the science and the economic departments, for Corona-related medicines. <br></td>

Measures that have been implemented<br>The Norwegian Research Council (RCN) has launched a COVID-19 Emergency Call for funding in order to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The aim is to support research that will enable us to understand and contain the new COVID-19, as well as to improve efficient patient management and public health (national and international) preparedness and response to the current and analogous outbreaks that may come in the future. The call for proposals is based on the recent research priorities defined by the WHO. International collaboration with research groups in other countries, including those funded by GLOPID-R member organisations to foster larger-scale studies, is encouraged. The scope of the proposals may include different topics, including health and economic aspects.

So far this has led to six new studies into the novel coronavirus, including testing a vaccine, developing therapies and improving understanding of how to treat COVID-19 (see: <a href="https://mrc.ukri.org/news/browse/covid-19-vaccine-therapy-research-boosted-by-six-new-projects-in-rapid-response/" target="_blank">https://mrc.ukri.org/news/browse/covid-1...</a>), while the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium will map how COVID-19 spreads and behaves by using whole genome sequencing (see: <a href="https://mrc.ukri.org/news/browse/uk-launches-whole-genome-sequence-alliance-to-map-spread-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank">https://mrc.ukri.org/news/browse/uk-laun...</a>). The race to find a vaccine for coronavirus will be boosted by £210m of new UK aid funding, following a virtual summit of G20 leaders for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for international research on vaccines (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-record-funding-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-an...</a>). <br><br>UKRI is continuing significant discussions across industry, government, and academia to identify new ways to utilise existing research and innovation capabilities to tackle the crisis.<br><br>On the 31st March UKRI launched a website to invite the submission of proposals for short term projects addressing and mitigating the health, social, economic and environmental impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. There is no closing date – proposals can be submitted at any time. UKRI will support excellent proposals of up to 18 months duration which meet at least one of the following:<br>• New research or innovation with a clear impact pathway that has the potential (within the period of the award) to deliver a significant contribution to the understanding of, and response to, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts.<br>• Supports the manufacture and/or wide scale adoption of an intervention with significant potential.<br>• Gathers critical data and resources quickly for future research use.<br></td>
