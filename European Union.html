      <th>What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>We will answer this as “informing EU policy and decision-making”:<br><br>Science-based guidance is essential. The European Commission launched an Advisory Panel on 17 March 2020 composed of epidemiologists and virologists from different Member States to formulate EU guidelines on science-based and coordinated risk management measures. The panel will be chaired by the Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and co-chaired by Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for health and food safety. The panel will provide advice to the Commission on the following:<br>• Formulation of response measures to be addressed to all Member States<br>• Identification and mitigation of significant gaps and inconsistencies in measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including in clinical management and treatment<br>• Prioritisation of health care, civil protection and other resources as well as support measures to be organised or coordinated at EU level<br>• Subsequently, recommendation of policy measures for addressing and mitigating long-term consequences of COVID-19.<br><br>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is closely monitoring this outbreak, providing risk assessments, public health guidance, and advice on response activities to EU Member States and the EU Commission.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>The European Commission is coordinating a common European response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Coordination efforts are wide-ranging and take place at the Commission, broader EU, Member State and international levels. The EC is taking resolute action to reinforce our public health sectors and mitigate the socio-economic impact in the European Union. There are active discussions between DG R&amp;I and the R&amp;I DGs of the national administrations to discuss the coordination of R&amp;I actions on COVID19.<br><br>The crisis coordination mechanism of the Commission has been activated and the Crisis Coordination Committee meets regularly to synergise the action of all the relevant departments and services of the Commission and of the EU agencies. It is chaired by Commissioner Janez Lenarčič in his role of European Emergency Response Coordinator. The Commission has also established a coordinating response team at political level composed of the commissioners responsible for the most affected policies.<br><br>External coordination on the R&amp;I response is ensured mainly through the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R). This is a network of preparedness research funders; the Commission funds its secretariat and is one of the vice chairs. Regular teleconferences are held between chairs and vice chairs of GloPID-R, and also with the World Health Organisation (WHO). The network is keen to create synergies between the different research efforts and avoid duplication.<br>Furthermore, bilateral talks are being held with those Member States that have indicated that they intend to provide support for Corona virus-related research in order to better understand the destinations being considered for their funding efforts.<br><br>Additionally, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), which is an initiative that focuses on vaccine development (the Commission is a financial contributor), is ‘fast forwarding’ a programme of vaccine development against COVID-19, aiming to initiate clinical trials of vaccine candidates and to support the development of hundreds of millions of doses.<br><br>The EU is assuming responsibility towards the African continent with insufficient health systems to cope – through the European &amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP).<br><br>The President of the European Commission has indicated after G20 that the EU stands ready to organise a pledging conference with focus on vaccine development.<br><br>The EU has a leading position on open science and is leading the way internationally by connecting initiatives launched by US (OSTP) and UNESCO Plea.</td>

      <th>Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>The Commission is active in the area of citizen outreach and communication: within the EC page for the Coronavirus response (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-trav...</a>), the Commission has launched a page to inform about all the EU research projects and initiatives to tackle the spread of COVID-19 and preparedness for other outbreaks: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/health-research-and-innovation/coronavirus-research_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-i...</a><br><br>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is closely monitoring this outbreak, providing risk assessments, public health guidance, and advice on response activities to EU Member States and the EU Commission.<br><br>On ‘fake news’, the European Commission is helping fight disinformation through a close cooperation with online platforms. The EC is encouraging them to promote authoritative sources, demote content that is fact-checked as false or misleading, and take down illegal content or content that could cause physical harm.<br><br>The European Commission has also raised attention to the rise of online scams and unfair practices: on 23 March 2020, Commissioner For Justice and Consumers Didier Reynders wrote to a number of platforms, social media, search engines and market places to require their cooperation in taking down scams from their platforms, following the common position endorsed by the CPC network. On 20 March 2020, the consumer protection (CPC) authorities of the Member States, with the support of the Commission, issued CPC Common Position COVID-19 on the most reported scams and unfair practices in this context. The objective is to ask and help online platform operators to better identify such illegal practices, take them down and prevent similar ones to reappear.<br></td>

      <th>What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>The Commission is providing direct support for research and innovation:<br><br>(i) Supporting new research and innovation<br>- On 30 January 2020, the Commission launched a call for expressions of interest for research projects advancing knowledge for the clinical and public health response to the COVID-19 epidemic. The deadline for submission was 12 February 2020. Ninety one proposals were received. The initially allocated budget of €10 million was subsequently increased to €47.5 million given the scale of the outbreak and the quality and potential of the research proposals submitted. Such rapid action was possible thanks to the standing budget line for public health emergency research funds included in the annual Work Programmes for health research of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. Following the evaluation of proposals on 25-26 February 2020, 17 research projects were shortlisted for funding. Collectively, they cover comprehensively the wide range of research questions related to this novel virus and the disease it causes. Research foci include the virus and disease dynamics, the development of rapid diagnostics, the exploration of different avenues for the development of therapeutics, and vaccine development.<br>- In addition, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private partnership between the EU and the pharmaceutical industry (through its association EFPIA), announced on 3 March 2020 a special fast track call for proposals for research projects. The projects should focus primarily on developing treatments and diagnostics to tackle better the current COVID-19 outbreak and increase preparedness for potential future outbreaks. The European Commission funds IMI through Horizon 2020 and will contribute up to €45 million to this call. A commitment of a similar scale is expected from the pharmaceutical industry so that the total investment could reach up to €90 million.  <br>- Another partnership supported by Horizon 2020, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials (public-public) Partnership (EDCTP2), which focuses on infectious diseases research in sub-Saharan Africa, also has a standing budget line to address public health emergencies and is likewise preparing to launch a call for expressions of interest for research projects to address the pandemic.<br>- The European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator pilot called on start-up companies and SMEs with technologies and innovations that could assist in the treatment of, testing for, monitoring of, or other aspects of the Corona virus outbreak.<br>- On 16 March, the Commission offered up to €80 million of financial support to CureVac, a highly innovative vaccine developer from Tübingen, Germany, to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the Coronavirus in Europe. The support would come in the form of an EU guarantee of a currently assessed EIB loan of an identical amount, in the framework of the InnovFin Infectious Disease Finance Facility under Horizon 2020.<br><br>(ii) Reorienting already on-going research<br>Over the course of the past few years, substantial investments have been made via Horizon 2020 in research preparedness projects, specifically in anticipation of this type of public health emergency; these research projects have early on (January) been mobilised to the maximum extent for the COVID-19 response. <br>- The project “PREPARE” (EU grant of €24 million) supports the research readiness of primary care providers and hospitals through a large network in 42 European countries. The project is currently in highest-level response mode, which implies the initiation and implementation of clinical research studies on SARS-CoV-2 across Europe.<br>- The project “European Virus Archive Global” (EU grant of €12.2 million) coordinates a virtual collection of viruses, to be used for e.g. diagnostic purposes; it has already responded to more than 1200 requests, providing access to the necessary material for diagnosing Corona virus infection. <br>- Other projects such as “VEO” (on diagnostics and data mining) or “MOOD” (on data mining and epidemic modelling) have only just started (on 1 January 2020) but have immediately refocused on the COVID-19 response.<br>- Finally, targeted exercises are ongoing to screen currently funded projects on potentially relevant activities, e.g. innovations in the fields of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, specialised isolation units for infected patients, tracking human mobility during epidemics, filtration technology to remove viral material, etc. that may be in the pipeline.<br><br>(iii) Speeding up research and achieving tangible societal impact by optimising enabling framework condition<br>- As for data sharing, the newly funded projects will need an infrastructure enabling them to share their data. Discussions have started with the currently funded “RECODID” project (one of its partners being EMBL) to explore how this project can facilitate and provide a common platform for data sharing. We aim for this platform to link with different European research infrastructures (EMBL being one example), to become part of the European Open Science Cloud, and to contribute to the future European Health Data Space.<br>- More broadly, the European Commission already has an open access mandate for publications with an embargo of 6 months allowed for STEM disciplines. The European Commission has signed the Statement on Data Sharing in Public Health Emergency along with other funders and institutions across the world in March 2020 for immediate open access to publications and data that advance the research on COVID-19. The European Commission will also provide guidelines recommending to researchers to practice immediate open access to their publications beyond what is formally asked of them, in view of addressing this crisis. <br><br>(iv) Drawing up an R&amp;I Action Plan within the ERA framework<br>The purpose of this R&amp;I action plan will be to identify first priority R&amp;I work streams for coordinated action between the Commission and the Member States taking action against the Corona virus that can be executed in the next weeks.  It will be a living document and will be updated regularly with additional R&amp;I coordinated actions. It will comprehend aspects linked to creating the ‘framework’ conditions for researchers such as access to data and to research infrastructures, and the coordination of clinical trials, as well as funding opportunities for researchers in different formats, and in a coordinated way.<br></td>

      <td>Q1B answers this question in more detail. <br>- Overall, Horizon 2020 involves an approach of consortia and/or partnerships for industry, researchers, innovators, to collaborate on R&amp;I responses. This also applies to the projects working on the Covid-19 outbreak.<br>- Moreover, through the European Research Area (ERA), the EC is also working to align R&amp;I responses at the Member-State level.</td>

      <th>What novel approaches, if any, is your country using to address the coronavirus crisis (e.g. use of machine learning, open science initiatives boosting access and sharing of data and research results, development and use of prediction models, etc.)?</th>
      <td>•  Specifically in response to COVID-19 the Commission has funded a series of projects with topics that range from improving epidemiology and public health to new treatments and vaccines for the virus, which include producing and sharing data and computational models on the specific virus. 17 projects have already been selected for funding specifically on the virus, while another call is ongoing until end March 2020.<br><br>• Additionally, large-scale European Research Infrastructures, such as ELIXIR, bring together primary data, models and other research resources on life sciences (including on COVID-19) across the EU and beyond. <br><br>• The Commission explores how swiftly to improve computational power for analysis, as well the storage of and access to COVID-19 raw research data (e.g. genomic data, clinical research data, epidemiological data or high dimensional data) through a European data platform for COVID-19 to be developed by EMBL-EBI, which would allow rapid sharing of research data and other relevant information by the research community and building on existing work by EMBL-EBI. <br><br>• The Commission coordinates the response to COVID-19-related services offered by Research Infrastructures, as well as supports the development of a discovery portal for COVID-19-relevant research outputs (data, publications and other).<br></td>

    <tr>
      <th>What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>Short-term impacts:<br>• Some impact on scientific  events (including e.g. health research related conferences), increased workload on health professionals (some impact on their research work) and potential slowdown in clinical trials activity.<br>• The mobility of human resources in science, technology and innovation is affected (including researchers, scientists, postdocs) but appears limited to some regions. The impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity is thus limited.<br>• Limited impact is also expected on global innovation networks process industries (incl. energy and resource intensive industries such as chemicals or steel) or materials research organisations.<br>• Low impact is expected on EU research &amp; innovation projects, as the participation of China in Horizon 2020 is low.<br><br>Medium-term impacts:<br>• A strong decrease in overall mobility across countries and places in the EU occurs, also for researchers and innovators operating outside of restricted areas, and this has a moderate impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity, which is largely based on such mobility.<br>• Regular postponement and cancellation of scientific events (including health research related conferences), clear overload of health professionals (with a detrimental effect on their research work) and recurrent delays and cancellation in clinical trials. All those are very likely to have a significant impact on scientific developments in the short to the medium run.<br>• Strong impact on global innovation networks and - depending on how the situation evolves - potential delays and a reduction of activities. China, US &amp; Germany host the world’s largest R&amp;D investor firms that perform R&amp;D activities away from headquarters. Large impact expected on the activities of those R&amp;D investors and on the work in related R&amp;D labs.<br><br>Long-term impacts:<br>• There is a very large estimated loss of total public &amp; private EU R&amp;D investments of -1.3% (€3.9bn) in 2020.<br>• The mobility of human resources in science, technology and innovation (including visiting researchers, staff exchanges) is marginal or close to zero, focusing only on a very limited set of health professionals that do research. This has a durable negative impact on Europe’s scientific production, breakthroughs and the translation of scientific outcomes into solutions, which will be very hard to reverse over the medium term, as national science capacity is built very progressively.<br>• The impact of the outbreak on global innovation networks is very strong with particularly hard impact expected on the activities of large R&amp;D investors (which are largely preforming their R&amp;D activities outside of EU headquarters) and on the work in related R&amp;D labs. This is particularly noticeable in countries such as Germany which host many of those large R&amp;D investing companies and labs. Innovation processes will slowdown as employees in R&amp;D labs and testing facilities may have to stay home.<br>• Among the 4 most affected third countries by COVID-19 (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran), 3 fall within the 20 most active countries in Horizon 2020. The impact of the outbreak under this scenario is larger for Horizon 2020, given that the 4 most affected countries represent 15% of the ongoing participations of the third countries in the programme. Actions under Horizon 2020 that imply networking of research groups will be more impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak.<br>• All major scientific events get postponed or cancelled (including health research related conferences), the overload of health professionals impedes them from doing any research work, and most clinical trials get cancelled. This scenario has major significant impacts on scientific developments in the medium run.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>Is there anything else regarding the STI policy response to Covid-19 in your country you would like to mention?</th>
      <td>Research &amp; innovation (R&amp;I) play a key role in the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly in provision of quick science driven solutions including better scientific understanding of the virus as well as development of treatments and diagnostics. R&amp;I also provides the technologies that allow for safer and faster tracking of the virus and fast diagnosis.<br>Health system’s capacities make a difference in terms of response to outbreaks.  Therefore, it is of paramount importance to invest in making national health systems stronger, more resilient and capable of a rapid and integrated response drawing on the latest scientific discoveries, ensuring equal access to healthcare across the EU. Horizon Europe plans to support R&amp;I activities aimed at strengthening health system’s resilience.<br><br>In the “post-covid world” we have three scenarios: (1) A return to business as usual? (2) “Normality” with “lessons- learned”? and (3) The dawn of a radically different reality? There are risks and opportunities coming from this crisis. On the one hand, climate transition is at risk, the return of state intervention or of state surveillance, or de-globalisation. On the other hand, the opportunities include the rise of self-organization and collective intelligence, knowledge sharing, social innovation, and a boom in solidarity. All these aspects impact society as well, for instance, in terms of individual freedom, impact of social distancing, the future of mobility, higher demand for transparency, government distrust, change of consumption patterns, among many others. This calls for foresight practices to look into the impacts on societies and the economy.</td>
