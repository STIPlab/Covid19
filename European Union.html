      <th>Q1A. What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>We will answer this as “informing EU policy and decision-making”:<br>New advisory structures<br> Advisory panel on COVID-19: group of epidemiologists and virologists to provide recommendations to the Commission on response measures, including policy measures for addressing and mitigating medium and long-term consequences of COVID-19, chaired by the Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and co-chaired by Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety. Established on 16.03.2020 by EC Decision C(2020)1799 T<br>The panel will provide advice to the Commission on the following:<br>Formulation of response measures to be addressed to all Member States<br>• Identification and mitigation of significant gaps and inconsistencies in measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including in clinical management and treatment<br>• Prioritisation of health care, civil protection and other resources as well as support measures to be organised or coordinated at EU level<br>• Subsequently, recommendation of policy measures for addressing and mitigating long-term consequences of COVID-19.<br><br> Special Advisor to President Von der Leyen: Peter Piot was appointed to advise the Commission in supporting and steering research and innovation (R&amp;I) in the global fight against COVID-19; he will also advise the Commission on increasing European preparedness in case of future epidemics making best use of research and innovation. This will imply advice on the acceleration of the development, manufacture and deployment of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines; also member of the above mentioned advisory panel.<br><br> COVID-19 Ad Hoc group: set up by EC together with MS in the framework of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan to strengthen the operational coordination of R&amp;I funding against COVID-19 covering the whole pipeline (from pre-clinical research to products being available to citizens) for vaccines, treatments and testing; work is carried out in four subgroups: (1) Clinical trials, (2) Manufacturing, (3) Testing, and (4) Financing.<br><br> Foresight: study on the scientific, technological and societal conditions for the end of the COVID 19 crisis; May-July 2020.<br><br> JRC Coronavirus Task Force: Set up to coordinate and connect the different scientific activities and contributions of the JRC to the EC’s COVID-19 response<br><br>Already existing advisory structures <br> The European Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control (ECDC): providing risk assessments, guidance, and advice on public health response activities to EU Member States and the EU Commission; it is also represented in the above-mentioned advisory panel on COVID-19.<br> The European Medicines Agency (EMA): providing advice to patients and healthcare professionals on the safe use of medicines during the pandemic, and providing scientific and regulatory advice to developers and companies on COVID-19.<br> EC’s Group of Chief Scientific Advisors: a group of highly qualified independent experts with the mandate to provide independent scientific advice and at the request of the College to inform its decision-making and thus contribute to the quality of EU legislation. <br> European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE): An independent, multi-disciplinary body, which advises on all aspects of Commission policies where ethical, societal and fundamental rights issues intersect with the development of science and new technologies. The EGE agreed to cooperate with the GCSA and Prof. Piot in the provision of science advice on COVID-19 (see above).<br> European Commission Expert Group “Economic and Societal Impact of Research and Innovation” (ESIR): a group of independent experts delivering analysis, insight and recommendations for the further elaboration of policies that can enhance the contribution of R&amp;I to the overall EU policy agenda. The ESIR group just published its first Policy Brief ‘Protect, prepare and transform Europe’ that fed into the Commission’s post-COVID-19 strategy (the recovery package).<br> The whole JRC has been mobilised to provide evidence that might support the tasks of Crisis Management while to start thinking in the aftermath of the crisis, including the elaboration of models to determine which are the most effective exit scenarios and their consequences. This includes, among other input, guidelines and control materials for testing and better characterization of the pandemics; epidemiological modelling; the detailed analysis on economic impact in different sectors (agriculture, energy supply, transport, …); the analysis of social aspects along with the environmental perspective; scientific input to supporting the African response to COVID-19; and more.  <br> The JRC’s Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre: The Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre (DRMKC) provides a networked approach to the science-policy interface in DRM, across the Commission, EU Member States and the DRM community within and beyond the EU. In the COVID-19 context, the DRMKC serves as one important network and platform to produce, assemble, store and share external and internal scientific research in response to the pandemic. Lessons learned report on COVID-19 crisis management will be part of the second “Science for Disaster Risk Management” flagship report.   <br><br></td>

      <th>Q1B. In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>The European Commission is coordinating a common European response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Coordination efforts are wide-ranging and take place at the Commission, broader EU, Member State and international levels. The EC is taking resolute action to reinforce our public health sectors and mitigate the socio-economic impact in the European Union. There are active discussions between DG R&amp;I and the R&amp;I DGs of the national administrations to discuss the coordination of R&amp;I actions on COVID19.<br><br>The crisis coordination mechanism of the Commission has been activated and the Crisis Coordination Committee meets regularly to synergise the action of all the relevant departments and services of the Commission and of the EU agencies. It is chaired by Commissioner Janez Lenarčič in his role of European Emergency Response Coordinator. The Commission has also established a coordinating response team at political level composed of the commissioners responsible for the most affected policies.<br><br>External coordination on the R&amp;I response is ensured mainly through the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R). This is a network of preparedness research funders; the Commission funds its secretariat and is one of the vice chairs. Regular teleconferences are held between chairs and vice chairs of GloPID-R, and also with the World Health Organisation (WHO). The network is keen to create synergies between the different research efforts and avoid duplication.<br>Furthermore, bilateral talks are being held with those Member States that have indicated that they intend to provide support for Corona virus-related research in order to better understand the destinations being considered for their funding efforts.<br><br>Additionally, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), which is an initiative that focuses on vaccine development (the Commission is a financial contributor), is ‘fast forwarding’ a programme of vaccine development against COVID-19, aiming to initiate clinical trials of vaccine candidates and to support the development of hundreds of millions of doses.<br><br>The EU is assuming responsibility towards the African continent with insufficient health systems to cope – through the European &amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP).<br><br>The President of the European Commission has indicated after G20 that the EU stands ready to organise a pledging conference with focus on vaccine development.<br><br>The EU has a leading position on open science and is leading the way internationally by connecting initiatives launched by US (OSTP) and UNESCO Plea.</td>

      <th>Q2.Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an ‘infodemic’ – a substantial increase of misinformation and targeted disinformation campaigns- that poses a twofold threat to the EU. Firstly, ‘infodemic’ has been proven to adversely impact public health by the dissemination of false and harmful information. Secondly, an advancement of geopolitical or commercial interests by malign actors.<br>The Commission is active in the area of citizen outreach and communication: within the EC page for the Coronavirus response (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-trav...</a>), the Commission has launched a page to inform about all the EU research projects and initiatives to tackle the spread of COVID-19 and preparedness for other outbreaks: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/health-research-and-innovation/coronavirus-research_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-i...</a> <br><br>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is closely monitoring this outbreak, providing risk assessments, public health guidance, and advice on response activities to EU Member States and the EU Commission.<br><br>On ‘fake news’, the European Commission is helping fight disinformation through close cooperation with online platforms. The EC is encouraging them to promote authoritative sources, demote content that is fact-checked as false or misleading, and take down illegal content or content that could cause physical harm.<br>In 2018, the Commission adopted a Communication on tackling online disinformation, together with a code of good practice for digital platforms and an action plan, aiming to protect the democratic systems of the EU MS. In this context, the European External Action Service runs the EUvsDisinfo website <a href="https://euvsdisinfo.eu/" target="_blank">https://euvsdisinfo.eu/</a> that detects narratives about the supposed superiority of authoritarian regimes in addressing COVID-19, as opposed to the perceived weaknesses of democracies. In addition, Europol provides advice on how to fight COVID-19 fake news, and a number of MS set up national task forces to monitor and counter country-specific false information. DG COMM set up a ‘Fighting disinformation’ corner under the Commission’s Coronavirus response website. DG R&amp;I has flagged multiple instances of harmful narratives, and developed and disseminated resources helpful in countering misinformation. DG R&amp;I also provided content for a new webpage listing EU-funded R&amp;I projects working against disinformation. A Communication Tackling COVID-19 disinformation - Getting the facts right on disinformation focussing on the COVID-19 specific issues on which DG R&amp;I already provided input was adopted on 10 June. <br>The European Commission has also raised attention to the rise of online scams and unfair practices: on 23 March 2020, Commissioner For Justice and Consumers Didier Reynders wrote to a number of platforms, social media, search engines and market places to require their cooperation in taking down scams from their platforms, following the common position endorsed by the CPC network. On 20 March 2020, the consumer protection (CPC) authorities of the Member States, with the support of the Commission, issued CPC Common Position COVID-19 on the most reported scams and unfair practices in this context. The objective is to ask and help online platform operators to better identify such illegal practices, take them down and prevent similar ones to reappear. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-tackling-covid-19-disinformation-getting-facts-right_en.pdf" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/fil...</a> <br></td>

Then, after revision and endorsement by the RDA governance bodies, the final version will be published on 30 June.<br><br>• OpenAIRE, in collaboration with the EC, will provide services to help in the sharing, discovery, navigation and collaboration of the global research community. In particular, a beta version of the service (operational) has now been released to serve as a single entry point for research results (publications, data, and software) for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. This service is linked to the other data sharing initiatives<br><br>• The European Open Science Cloud Secretariat has introduced a fast-track procedure to apply for funding, specifically dedicated to activities related to COVID-19 in the area of Open Science and research data sharing. The deadline for applications is on 12 June.<br><br>Platform to share Information<br>• DG SANTE’s Health Policy Platform - In order to facilitate easy communication between researchers on initial and unconfirmed observations, a moderated space called “researchers chat” (with restricted access) was set up on DG SANTE’s Health Policy Platform. This allows low-threshold exchange between researchers from different projects, promoting also interdisciplinary connections. <br><br>• The European Commission launched (14 May) the new European Research Area (ERA) corona platform. The ERA corona platform is a one-stop shop for information for current and prospective beneficiaries of the R&amp;I Programmes The platform provides useful information, dedicated support and real-time updates on funding opportunities for coronavirus related research and innovation. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is facing unprecedented challenges in the search for solutions against coronavirus. Good coordination and quick mobilisation of funds are essential to help our researchers and innovators meet those challenges. <br><br>Pan-EU Hackathon<br>• The European Commission under the patronage of Cssr Mariya Gabriel, in close collaboration with EU member states, host an online Pan-EU Hackathon April 24 -26 (#EUvsVirus) to connect civil society, innovators, partners and buyers across Europe to develop innovative solutions to overcome coronavirus-related challenges.  The ‘Winning’ solutions in each challenge area were announced (April 30) here. Winners were invited to a Matchathon that took place 22 - 25 May on the new EIC COVID Platform was created to facilitate connections with end users, such as hospitals, and provide access to investors, foundations and other funding opportunities from across the EU. <br><br>Seal of Excellence<br>• On 8 May, the European Commission granted the first batch of the EIC COVID-19 Response Seal of Excellence to 82 excellent proposals addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. On 4 June, after the final selection, the second batch of COVID-19 related seals was granted to 57 COVID related Seal proposals making a total of 139 COVID-19 seals with a total amount of support of EUR 384 million. The proposals were submitted under European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator Pilot (March 20 cut-off). The Seal certificate, co-signed now by Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, and by Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira, is addressed to excellent proposals from the EIC Accelerator call which have been evaluated worth of funding but for which Horizon Europe does not have enough resources in the call. <br><br>Ethics<br>• One of the main obstacles to the speedy launch of clinical trials being the slow and complex approval by the appropriate committees, the Commission is asking projects to raise any issues they may encounter in this respect and encouraging Member States to look into these issues by priority. European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) Statement on European solidarity and the protection of fundamental rights in the COVID-19 pandemic (2 April).The EGE calls for a rallying of solidarity at the European and global level and underlines the core ethical considerations that must shape the pathway out of the pandemic.<br>Adequacy regulatory point of view<br>• Where relevant, projects are asked to engage with the European Medical Agency (EMA) in order to ensure from an early stage onwards the adequacy of the proposals from a regulatory point of view. <br><br>3. TRANSLATING RESEARCH FINDINGS INTO PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY FOR PANDEMIC RESPONSE <br><br>• Initial research findings may inform the public health response. The Horizon 2020 model grant agreement obliges the early dissemination of such findings. Another specific moderated space called “research to policy action” (with restricted access) has been set up on DG SANTE’s Health Policy Platform for the posting of such findings and for review of their relevance (and possible recommendations to the Health Security Committee) by the European Centre for Disease Prevention &amp; Control (ECDC)<br><br>4. COOPERATION AND COORDINATION <br>Coordination/ cooperation with MS, AC and at international level<br>• The dynamic ERAvsCorona Action Plan - short-term coordinated R&amp;I actions identifies the first 10 priority R&amp;I work streams for coordinated action between the Commission and the Member States has received support at the informal video conference of ministers of research, 7 April. <br><br>• On 29 May, in the informal High Level Video-Conference ,the R&amp;I Ministers debated on the lessons learnt from the research and innovation response to the COVID-19 outbreak, on how R&amp;I investments can be best used to boost future jobs and on the role of R&amp;I in the recovery. Ministers reaffirmed the importance of R&amp;I investments at European and national level, and anchoring science at the heart of policy formulation.

      <th>Q5. What novel approaches, if any, is your country using to address the coronavirus crisis (e.g. use of machine learning, open science initiatives boosting access and sharing of data and research results, development and use of prediction models, etc.)?</th>
      <td>Research Infrastructures<br>• Horizon 2020 grants access to essential Research Infrastructure (RI) services are repurposing their calls and considering stepped-up efforts to focus on COVID-19. Beyond the European Virus Archive and TRANSVAC for vaccine research, this includes other EU supported pan-European RIs: SoBigData-Plus (big data analytics); ERINHA (high-risk pathogen safety labs); ELIXIR (coordinating the storage of and access to biological data); ECRIN (clinical trials). CALIPSO-PLUS and CERIC-ERIC have set up a dedicated Fast Track Access to a selected number of analytical facilities for research related to the COVID-19. <br>Research data sharing<br>• DG R&amp;I in close collaboration with DG SANTE, DG CONNECT and EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), together with EU Member States and research partners such as ELIXIR, has launched (20 April) the European COVID-19 research data platform. This joint effort is a priority pilot to realise the goals of European Open Science Cloud and is part of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan. This will allow the scientific community to share, analyse, and process data rapidly, openly and effectively across the Member States and the globe. <br><br>• To complement the platform deployment, the EC is urging all H2020 projects working on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 to provide immediate open access to their related publications, data and any other output. To support them, a guidance document has been developed that includes specific guidelinees regarding FAIR principles, Open Access to publications and data, etc.<br><br>• The Research Data Alliance Working Group on COVID-19 has gathered more than 300 domain and data experts from all over the world to produce a set of guidelines and recommendations for data sharing in public health emergencies to support scientific research and policy making. It covers data from 5 sub-groups focusing on essential thematic areas: Clinical, Community Participation, Epidemiology, Omics, and Social Sciences. The 5th (pre final) release of the COVID-19 Recommendations and Guidelines was published on 28 May and it is open for comments until 8 June. Then, after revision and endorsement by the RDA governance bodies, the final version will be published on 30 June.<br><br>• OpenAIRE, in collaboration with the EC, will provide services to help in the sharing, discovery, navigation and collaboration of the global research community. In particular, a beta version of the service (operational) has now been released to serve as a single entry point for research results (publications, data, and software) for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. This service is linked to the other data sharing initiatives<br><br>• The European Open Science Cloud Secretariat has introduced a fast-track procedure to apply for funding, specifically dedicated to activities related to COVID-19 in the area of Open Science and research data sharing. The deadline for applications is on 12 June.<br><br>Platform to share Information<br>• DG SANTE’s Health Policy Platform - In order to facilitate easy communication between researchers on initial and unconfirmed observations, a moderated space called “researchers chat” (with restricted access) was set up on DG SANTE’s Health Policy Platform. This allows low-threshold exchange between researchers from different projects, promoting also interdisciplinary connections. <br><br>• The European Commission launched (14 May) the new European Research Area (ERA) corona platform. The ERA corona platform is a one-stop shop for information for current and prospective beneficiaries of the R&amp;I Programmes The platform provides useful information, dedicated support and real-time updates on funding opportunities for coronavirus related research and innovation. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is facing unprecedented challenges in the search for solutions against coronavirus. Good coordination and quick mobilisation of funds are essential to help our researchers and innovators meet those challenges. <br><br>Pan-EU Hackathon<br>• The European Commission under the patronage of Cssr Mariya Gabriel, in close collaboration with EU member states, host an online Pan-EU Hackathon April 24 -26 (#EUvsVirus) to connect civil society, innovators, partners and buyers across Europe to develop innovative solutions to overcome coronavirus-related challenges.  The ‘Winning’ solutions in each challenge area were announced (April 30) here. Winners were invited to a Matchathon that took place 22 - 25 May on the new EIC COVID Platform was created to facilitate connections with end users, such as hospitals, and provide access to investors, foundations and other funding opportunities from across the EU. <br><br>Seal of Excellence<br>• On 8 May, the European Commission granted the first batch of the EIC COVID-19 Response Seal of Excellence to 82 excellent proposals addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. On 4 June, after the final selection, the second batch of COVID-19 related seals was granted to 57 COVID related Seal proposals making a total of 139 COVID-19 seals with a total amount of support of EUR 384 million. The proposals were submitted under European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator Pilot (March 20 cut-off). The Seal certificate, co-signed now by Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, and by Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira, is addressed to excellent proposals from the EIC Accelerator call which have been evaluated worth of funding but for which Horizon Europe does not have enough resources in the call. <br><br>Ethics<br>• One of the main obstacles to the speedy launch of clinical trials being the slow and complex approval by the appropriate committees, the Commission is asking projects to raise any issues they may encounter in this respect and encouraging Member States to look into these issues by priority. European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) Statement on European solidarity and the protection of fundamental rights in the COVID-19 pandemic (2 April).The EGE calls for a rallying of solidarity at the European and global level and underlines the core ethical considerations that must shape the pathway out of the pandemic.<br></td>

      <th>Q6A. What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>Short-term impacts:<br>• Some impact on scientific  events (including e.g. health research related conferences), increased workload on health professionals (some impact on their research work) and potential slowdown in clinical trials activity.<br>• The mobility of human resources in science, technology and innovation is affected (including researchers, scientists, postdocs) but appears limited to some regions. The impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity is thus limited.<br>• Limited impact is also expected on global innovation networks process industries (incl. energy and resource intensive industries such as chemicals or steel) or materials research organisations.<br>• Low impact is expected on EU research &amp; innovation projects, as the participation of China in Horizon 2020 is low.<br><br>Medium-term impacts:<br>• A strong decrease in overall mobility across countries and places in the EU occurs, also for researchers and innovators operating outside of restricted areas, and this has a moderate impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity, which is largely based on such mobility.<br>• Regular postponement and cancellation of scientific events (including health research related conferences), clear overload of health professionals (with a detrimental effect on their research work) and recurrent delays and cancellation in clinical trials. All those are very likely to have a significant impact on scientific developments in the short to the medium run.<br>• Strong impact on global innovation networks and - depending on how the situation evolves - potential delays and a reduction of activities. China, US &amp; Germany host the world’s largest R&amp;D investor firms that perform R&amp;D activities away from headquarters. Large impact expected on the activities of those R&amp;D investors and on the work in related R&amp;D labs.<br><br>Long-term impacts:<br>• There is a very large estimated loss of total public &amp; private EU R&amp;D investments of -1.3% (€3.9bn) in 2020.<br>• The mobility of human resources in science, technology and innovation (including visiting researchers, staff exchanges) is marginal or close to zero, focusing only on a very limited set of health professionals that do research. This has a durable negative impact on Europe’s scientific production, breakthroughs and the translation of scientific outcomes into solutions, which will be very hard to reverse over the medium term, as national science capacity is built very progressively.<br>• The impact of the outbreak on global innovation networks is very strong with particularly hard impact expected on the activities of large R&amp;D investors (which are largely preforming their R&amp;D activities outside of EU headquarters) and on the work in related R&amp;D labs. This is particularly noticeable in countries such as Germany which host many of those large R&amp;D investing companies and labs. Innovation processes will slowdown as employees in R&amp;D labs and testing facilities may have to stay home.<br>• Among the 4 most affected third countries by COVID-19 (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran), 3 fall within the 20 most active countries in Horizon 2020. The impact of the outbreak under this scenario is larger for Horizon 2020, given that the 4 most affected countries represent 15% of the ongoing participations of the third countries in the programme. Actions under Horizon 2020 that imply networking of research groups will be more impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak.<br>• All major scientific events get postponed or cancelled (including health research related conferences), the overload of health professionals impedes them from doing any research work, and most clinical trials get cancelled. This scenario has major significant impacts on scientific developments in the medium run.</td>

      <th>Q6B. Is support of the STI system part of planned stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy?</th>
      <td>Research and innovation (R&amp;I) play an essential role in the response to the Covid-19 outbreak. They are also critical levers to ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery, while boosting the resilience of our production sectors, the competitiveness of our economies and the transformation of our socio-economic systems. Research and innovation actions are an essential part of the coordinated EU response to the public health threat of Covid-19. They channel public and private investments and align funding and investment streams to underpin the Recovery. In the current context, we need science-driven solutions, including better scientific understanding of the virus as well as the development of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. R&amp;I also provides the technologies that allow for safer and faster tracking of the virus. In global emergencies, such as the Covid19 pandemic, it is essential to remove all obstacles to the free flow of data, researchers and ideas. Full, timely and fair access to scientific information and research results during crises for researchers, journalists, medical staff and all citizens is of outmost importance for accurate and affordable science-based responses. Moreover, openly accessible, machine-readable, interoperable data is needed to follow the spread of the epidemic, and forecast its rapid evolution. Key datasets include clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data. It is of crucial importance to invest in stronger and more resilient national health systems, capable of rapid and integrated responses drawing on the latest scientific discoveries, with equal access across the EU.</td>

Horizon Europe plans to support R&amp;I activities aimed at strengthening health system’s resilience.<br><br>In the “post-covid world” we have three scenarios: (1) A return to business as usual? (2) “Normality” with “lessons- learned”? and (3) The dawn of a radically different reality? There are risks and opportunities coming from this crisis. On the one hand, climate transition is at risk, the return of state intervention or of state surveillance, or de-globalisation. On the other hand, the opportunities include the rise of self-organization and collective intelligence, knowledge sharing, social innovation, and a boom in solidarity. All these aspects impact society as well, for instance, in terms of individual freedom, impact of social distancing, the future of mobility, higher demand for transparency, government distrust, change of consumption patterns, among many others. This calls for foresight practices to look into the impacts on societies and the economy.</td>
