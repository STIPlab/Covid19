It is also part of the Presidential Emergency Committee, that brings together many authorities (including the Presidency, the Ministers of Health, Defense, General Government Secretariat, among others, and the Undersecretaries of Public Health and Assistance Networks, also among others).</td>

      <th>What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>The Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge e Innovation together with CORFO and the support of the Government Laboratory, launched two calls of Covid-19 Innovation Challenges. <br>The first one is focused on generating rapid implementation solutions for the local demand of personal health protection elements related to possible contagion by droplets and personal contact (mask, gloves, health clothing, etc). This call will bring a CL$90 million (US$104.000) grant per project in two stages, during 6 months.<br><a href="https://www.corfo.cl/sites/cpp/convocatorias/retos_de_innovacion_elementos_de_proteccion_covid19" target="_blank">https://www.corfo.cl/sites/cpp/convocato...</a> <br><br>The second one calls entrepreneurs, companies, universities and technology centers to register their developments in diagnostic technologies for COVID19 as well as other viral pathogens that affect human health. These technologies could cover the entire chain from sampling, extraction supplies, reagents, others, to diagnosis and its results. This registration does not involve financing.<br><a href="https://www.corfo.cl/sites/cpp/convocatorias/retos_de_innovacion_covid19" target="_blank">https://www.corfo.cl/sites/cpp/convocato...</a> <br></td>

      <td>1.- Enhancing the national diagnostic capabilities.<br><br>The Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation, along with the National Research and Development Agency (ANID), scientific societies and universities, in a February 18th meeting, identified the need to amplify the diagnostic capabilities of the certified network of the National Public Health Institute (ISP), in order to react to the COVID-19 pandemic (sampling and detection).<br><br>• A Network of Certified University Research Labs was created, changing their operation to emergency COVID-19 diagnostic centers, reaching the whole country, north to south: nine are currently functioning, seven are ready to start processing samples, and five are calibrating equipment (as of April 21st).<br>• To support this Network, a CLP 1500000 fund was created by the Ministry, and allocated by ANID.<br><br>2.- Mechanical Ventilators:<br><br>The Chilean Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation and the Ministry of Economy, in collaboration with SOFOFA Hub, Socialab and the Inter-American Development Bank launched the “Un respiro para Chile (A breath for Chile)” initiative (<a href="https://cl.socialab.com/challenges/unrespiroparachile" target="_blank">https://cl.socialab.com/challenges/unres...</a>), a public-private platform, with the goal to promote the development and upscaling of local ventilator prototypes.<br>• These ventilators may be developed by universities, companies or others, and must follow the technical specs of the National Health Institute (ISP) and the Chilean Society of Intensive Medicine (SOCHIMI)<br>• SOCHIMI will conduct a thorough technical evaluation and the Ministry of Health will provide an emergency certification.<br>• As of April 21st, 35 projects were filed by developers, and 5 were pre-selected, according to the fulfilment of security criteria, local material procurement and availability, technical maturity of the manufacturing process, and their technical teams’ capacities.<br>• During the next 2 weeks, SOCHIMI will tests the five prototypes.</td>
