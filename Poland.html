      <td>1) The National Centre for Research and Development allocated 200 000 000 PLN to fight against coronavirus.<br>The Polish entrepreneurs and scientists who work on diagnostics, treatment and prevention of viral diseases obtained 200 000 000 PLN. The National Centre for Research and Development announced the Fast Track &#34;Coronavirus&#34; contest. In order to fight against coronavirus pandemic was used a proven formula to finance innovation from the European Funds.<br>The National Centre for Research and Development envisaged three basic thematic areas which should include projects submitted for co-financing. There are the following:<br>- diagnostics - devices for quickly detecting the coronavirus presence in the bod;<br>- treatment - researches on the use of existing or new drugs as well as works on vaccines.<br>- prevention - preventive measures limiting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the activities to the Polish antivirus shield: improving biosecurity, protecting society  and supporting its functioning in epidemiological crisis situations.<br>Both SMEs and large companies as well as consortia consisting of entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs and scientific units can apply for support. The main condition of receiving the grant is the innovation of the proposed solution at least at the national level as well as the need to its implement on the market. The projects submitted for funding in the contest may include industrial researches, experimental development and pre-implementation works. Only experimental development works are treated as mandatory element. The minimum project value for single SME is 1 000 000 PLN and for large companies and consortia 2 000 000 PLN. The maximum value of eligible costs of projects co-financed by the National Centre for Research and Development may not exceed 50 000 000 EUR.</td>
