      <td>1) The National Centre for Research and Development allocated 200 000 000 PLN to fight against coronavirus.<br>The Polish entrepreneurs and scientists who work on diagnostics, treatment and prevention of viral diseases obtained 200 000 000 PLN. The National Centre for Research and Development announced the Fast Track &#34;Coronavirus&#34; contest. A proven formula to finance innovation from the European Funds was used in order to fight against coronavirus pandemic.<br>The National Centre for Research and Development envisaged three basic thematic areas which should include projects submitted for co-financing. There are the following:<br>- diagnostics - devices for quickly detecting the coronavirus presence in the body;<br>- treatment - researches on the use of existing or new drugs as well as works on vaccines;<br>- prevention - preventive measures limiting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the activities to the Polish antivirus shield: improving biosecurity, protecting society  and supporting its functioning in epidemiological crisis situations.<br>Both SMEs and large companies as well as consortia consisting of entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs and scientific units can apply for support. The main condition of receiving the grant is the innovation of the proposed solution at least at the national level as well as the need to its implement on the market. The projects submitted for funding in the contest may include industrial researches, experimental development and pre-implementation works. Only experimental development works are treated as mandatory element. The minimum project value for single SME is 1 000 000 PLN and for large companies and consortia - 2 000 000 PLN. The maximum value of eligible costs of projects co-financed by the National Centre for Research and Development may not exceed 50 000 000 EUR.<br>                                           <br>                                           2) Express call to fund research on COVID-19 by the National Science Centre with a total budget of 10 mln PLN<br><a href="https://www.ncn.gov.pl/ogloszenia/konkursy/covid-19?language=en" target="_blank">https://www.ncn.gov.pl/ogloszenia/konkur...</a><br><br>                                          3) Changes to the terms of the CEUS-UNISONO call for proposals related to the launch of the FWF Urgent Funding for Research Into <br>                                              Humanitarian Crises like Epidemics and Pandemics with participation of the National Science Centre<br><a href="https://ncn.gov.pl/aktualnosci/2020-04-08-zmiana-warunkow-konkursu-ceus-unisono?language=en" target="_blank">https://ncn.gov.pl/aktualnosci/2020-04-0...</a><br><br>                                           4) Support for hospitals focusing on COVID-19 related patients by the National Centre for Research and Development with a total budget of 100 <br>                                               mln PLN <br>The National Centre for Research and Development launched a new support for hospitals focusing on COVID-19 related patients on R&amp;D activities. These hospitals can apply for funding projects preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, protecting personnel and treating COVID-19.<br><br><br>5) Additional support for research (including on COVID-19) at the Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology - Jagiellonian University – one-off funding from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of 25 000 000 PLN. Money for the Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology - Jagiellonian University should help in developing coronavirus vaccine.  <br><br><br>6) Production of the Polish coronavirus tests<br>The prototype of the Polish coronavirus test was developed by the researchers from the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Poznan. It will be possible to produce 100,000 pieces - based on the reagents of own production and the Polish companies. The National Centre for Research and Development allocated 100 000 000 PLN for this project.<br><br>7) IDUB against COVID-19 contest organized by the Warsaw University of Technology <br>Financing activities on solutions dedicated to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects is the main goal of this contest. Projects may concern both the area of basic researches and R&amp;D works. The maximum project implementation period is 18 months and the project financing amount should not exceed 400 000 PLN. <br><br><br></td>
