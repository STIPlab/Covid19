      <th>What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Covid-19 relevant activities are coordinated by an inter-ministerial Committee, headed by the Vice Minister for Civil Protection and Crisis Management. Others participating in the Committee include representatives of the Prime Minister&#39;s Cabinet, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Health, the General Secretariat of Civil Protection, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Development and Investments.<br><br>As far as scientific advice is concerned, an Expert Committee has been established under the authority of the Ministry of Health, comprising immunologists, epidemiologists, experts on infectious diseases, statisticians and mathematicians.<br></td>

      <td>Greece participates to the relevant activities and organs of the European Union, the World Health Organization and other international organizations.<br><br>The Greek Government has nominated as official representative to the International Organizations for coronavirus issues, Professor Elias Mossialos, (Head of Department of Health Policy and Director of LSE Health at the London School of Economics). <br></td>

    <tr>
      <th>Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Official information and scientific advice to the public is delivered daily from the mass media. Facts, data, scientific information (including alerts on fake news and rumors), measures and recommendations are provided by the Chair of the Expert Committee (see responses to Question 1), Professor Sotiris Tsiodras (University of Athens, Medical School), the representatives of the General Secretariat of Civil Protection, and other representatives of the Greek Government. There is considerable social pressure, raised through social media, to silence divergent opinions contradicting mainstream government policy and proposing different approaches to management of the outbreak. Similarly, the electronic marketing of products promoted as protecting from the virus is socially condemned. Αll the political spectrum stands behind this government action.<br><br>Citizens can also get sound information and guidance directly from the National Public Health Organization (Ministry of Health) (<a href="https://eody.gov.gr/neos-koronaios-covid-19/" target="_blank">https://eody.gov.gr/neos-koronaios-covid...</a>) through a 24-hour available phone line. <br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>1) Testing for the virus is done by the Hellenic Pasteur Institute (<a href="https://www.pasteur.gr" target="_blank">https://www.pasteur.gr</a>), the national COVid-19 Reference Centre. Testing is up until now limited to those with serious symptoms. It is not possible to extend testing to the symptom-free population, mainly due to shortages in reagents and essential consumables. Epidemiological data are stored for all samples. However, it is still early days for concrete epidemiological studies. <br><br>2) Several Greek public Research Centers and Universities have joined forces to contribute to the national effort to broaden testing of the population under an initiative of the National Council for Research &amp; Innovation and the National Public Health Organization. This plan has not been fully implemented yet until all biosafety requirements are met and all controls are completed. As a first phase, the plan includes the Laboratory of Hygiene and Epidemiology of the University of Athens (<a href="https://dehems.med.uoa.gr" target="_blank">https://dehems.med.uoa.gr</a>), the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens (<a href="https://www.bioacademy.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.bioacademy.gr/</a>) and the Institute of Applied Biosciences at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (<a href="https://www.inab.certh.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.inab.certh.gr/</a>). Further research entities are also appropriately equipped in order to detect SARS-COV-2 by real time PCR, such as, for example, the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH) (<a href="https://www.imbb.forth.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.imbb.forth.gr/</a>). The latter has also developed an innovative technology based on biosensors for the direct detection of virus particles of SARS-COV-2. They are in consultation with the Reference Centre of the Pasteur Institute in order to perform tests. A spin-off company has been created by FORTH for the next steps and exploitation of research results. <br><br>3) There are important research activities in the field of biology of viruses (among them the family of coronaviruses) along with the reaction of the human immune system to viral infections. Such research is mostly undertaken at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology / FORTH, but also at the other biomedical research Institutes. Substantial work is also being done in the field of epidemiological modelling of the virus spread dynamics with mathematical and computer models. <br><br>4) On treatment for COVID-19, Greece is already implementing a strategy of drug-repositioning / re-purposing for already approved drugs. Several research groups along with enterprises are working in this field.<br></td>

      <th>At national level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>

      <th>At international level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>At the European level, as for the priorities for EU coordinated R&amp;I action for COVID19, we support the initiatives and actions taken by the European Commission, especially on vaccines and treatment. We welcome the dedicated call of the Health Program with a budget of 47,5 M€.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>What novel approaches, if any, is your country using to address the coronavirus crisis (e.g. use of machine learning, open science initiatives boosting access and sharing of data and research results, development and use of prediction models, etc.)?</th>
      <td>1) The Research Centre « Athena » (<a href="https://www.athena-innovation.gr/" target="_blank">https://www.athena-innovation.gr/</a>) has developed a web based tool to ease the exploration of COVID-19-related literature, the so-called  “BIP! Finder for COVID-19” (<a href="https://bip.covid19.athenarc.gr/" target="_blank">https://bip.covid19.athenarc.gr/</a>), as well as a dataset containing impact metrics and indicators for a set of publications that are related to the COVID-19 infectious disease and the coronavirus that causes it. It is based on the CORD-19 dataset released by the team of Semantic Scholar (<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/" target="_blank">https://www.semanticscholar.org/</a>) in response to the ongoing pandemic. The short-term &amp; long-term impact (citation popularity/reading hype &amp; influence, respectively) of the corresponding publications has been calculated using data from the underlying citation network (PMC and OpenCitations COCI) and Mendeley.<br><br>2) The Centre of Earth Observation Research and Satellite Remote Sensing of BEYOND of the National Observatory of Athens operates the Web GIS open platform illustrating the daily expansion of COVID-19 at the national and international level (<a href="http://webgiscovid19.beyond-eocenter.eu/" target="_blank">http://webgiscovid19.beyond-eocenter.eu/...</a>).<br><br>3) Some research teams in Greek Universities (University of Thessaly, University of Thessaloniki) produce by 3-D printing respiratory devices and/or protection material for COVID-19, which are offered to local hospitals.  <br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>The current global crisis due to coronavirus will have a particularly negative impact both on the public research system and on the companies involved in research projects (mostly SMEs but also several large companies with R&amp;D activities). Most R&amp;D project funding in Greece is provided by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) through the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF). In particular, the beneficiary companies already face severe liquidity problems and will hardly comply with the requirements of the ESIF Regulations in order to receive the installments foreseen in the funding contracts. We believe that the risk of not implementing or not completing the research projects is particularly high and such a development would have disastrous consequences for the businesses themselves, but also for the absorption of the NSRF 2014-20 funds. Consequently, we plan to negotiate an extension of eligibility of expenses of the current programming period up to 2025.<br><br>At the administration level we are taking all possible measures to ameliorate the effects of restrictions and closures to our universities, research centres and enterprises. We, therefore, extended all deadlines for submission of proposals for R&amp;I projects as well as those for interim monitoring and completion of running projects, upon request by the coordinators. At the same time we will make every effort to speed up the administrative steps and audits for interim / final reviews of projects and to allow / enable timely payments to the enterprises and research organizations that implement and complete their projects. <br></td>
