      <td>In Lithuania, a Government Emergency Commission (headed by the Minister of Health) has been set up, which, together with the Government Office, is in direct contact with leading research centres on some operational issues on the latest scientific information related to COVID 19. One such centre - Vilnius University Life Sciences Centre (VU GMC) - has set up an analytical centre for this purpose, which collects and submits weekly scientific information to the Emergency Response Centre and the Government Office. VU GMC also mobilized diaspora researchers to search for scientific information and new methods.</td>

Currently, processes are taking place at the operational level, where society, science and business are struggling to respond to the needs expressed by the Government Emergency Commission.<br>In parallel, Lithuanian researchers are preparing to join international initiatives in the field of COVID19 research.<br>Research Council of Lithuania is considering initiating a research program related to COVID19.<br>The Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology has launched a call &#34;Life saving-innovations: stop COVID-19&#34; with simplified procedures. The call is open for innovators, technology developers, start-ups and innovative companies that can offer research- and innovation-based unconventional solutions to manage the COVID-19 crisis. After the selection the best projects will be funded from the EU SF instrument „Inostartas” (52,000 euro / project).<br><br>Here are some examples of ongoing initiatives:<br><br>- Lithuanian robotics company &#34;Rubedo sistemos&#34;, that  is developing a unique disinfecting robot that can help fighting COVID-19. This autonomous robot has great potential for future applications: it can be used in hospitals, quarantine facilities, offices, schools, supermarkets, warehouses and airports. <br>- A hackathon (Hack the Crisis was organized in Lithuania on 20-22 March: <a href="https://hackthecrisis.lt/" target="_blank">https://hackthecrisis.lt/</a>) specifically designed to respond to the Covid-19 crisis.<br>- Vilnius University Life Sciences Centre has handed over laboratory disinfection equipment to the National Cancer Institute to disinfect patients&#39; wards.<br>- VU GMC has set up an analytical center where it selects and provides the government with the latest scientific information on COVID 19 once a week;<br>- Lithuanian scientists are also looking for the possibility to produce the necessary reagents for COVID19 research.<br><br><br></td>
