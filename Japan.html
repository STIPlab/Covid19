      <td>・Japan participates in the conference call with government science leaders around the world hosted by the United States to gather and provide information on COVID-19.<br>・The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), together with research support agencies and journal publishers around the world, signed a statement on sharing research data and findings relevant to the COVID-19 outbreak and working to ensure that this does not disadvantage the publication of scientific papers.<br>・The National Institute of Infectious Diseases（NIID）has succeeded in isolating the novel coronavirus, and provided it to countries around the world for research and development without compensation.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>In the short-term, research exchanges and international research collaboration are expected to stagnate due to restrictions on overseas travel. MEXT has permitted the flexible use of funds for the support of researchers&#39; overseas travel, and has been working to ensure that research exchanges will be promoted as usual after the situation is improved.<br>In the medium- and long-term, it is expected that private investment for R&amp;D will decrease due to economic recession. Additionally, the needs of providing scientific evidence in order to adequately respond to infectious diseases and the importance of further deepening international cooperation for addressing infectious diseases will grow. It is necessary to establish a framework for sharing knowledge and data on infectious diseases across countries.<br></td>
