      <td>the lack of a response is outrageous. The federal government, despite what some ministries concerns, seems oblivious to the crisis. They took to long to respond and order a forced quarantine and there is not enough resources at the moment to be prepared to the health crisis approaching rapidly. with the crash of the health system months ago and the lack of preparedness for public procurement, it seems that having access to health care will not be what the crisis calls for. Neither public nor private health systems will have the resources to provide proper care to the ill. Also there is a lack support to those with an informal source of income will not allow for a proper isolation to reduce the spread of the disease</td>
