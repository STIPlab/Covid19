      <td>Research &amp; innovation (R&amp;I) play a key role in the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly in provision of quick science driven solutions including better scientific understanding of the virus as well as development of treatments and diagnostics. R&amp;I also provides the technologies that allow for safer and faster tracking of the virus and fast diagnosis.<br>Health system’s capacities make a difference in terms of response to outbreaks.  Therefore, it is of paramount importance to invest in making national health systems stronger, more resilient and capable of a rapid and integrated response drawing on the latest scientific discoveries, ensuring equal access to healthcare across the EU. Horizon Europe plans to support R&amp;I activities aimed at strengthening health system’s resilience.<br>In the “post-covid world” we have three scenarios: 1) A return to business as usual? ;“Normality” with “lessons- learned”?; 3) The dawn of a radically different reality?. There are risks and opportunities coming from this crisis. On the one hand, climate transition is at risk, the return of state intervention or of state surveillance, or de-globalisation. On the other hand, the opportunities include the rise of self-organization and collective intelligence, knowledge sharing, social innovation, boom in solidarity. All these aspects impacting society as well, for instance in terms of individual freedom, impact of social distancing, the future of mobility, higher demand for transparency, government distrust, change of consumption patterns, among many others. This calls for foresight practices to look into the impacts on societies and the economy.</td>

      <td>Building an evidence base on behavior and perceptions with regard to Covid-19 is an important priority.   Thought the Human Science Research Council (HSRC),  an online survey is conducted to better understand current behaviours and patterns.  As at 27 March 2020, about 2,400 people have responded to the survey. The sample size has increased but a statistician has been commissioned to assess the quality of the responses and data after which analysis can be done.   The public will be kept informed on the outcome of the results of this survey.  The HSRC is also currently pulling together a range of efforts in this space including work specifically focus on rural communities (SAPRIN), social media sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques.   A number of researchers as well as private sector players have expressed a willingness to assist. Follow-ups are being made on how best they can support a national effort. A call has been made to survey companies in the private sector to join hands with government to better understand the behaviours and perceptions of our people.  Through the HSRC a system will be also be introduced of dynamic updates on behavior and perception issues as these will change on an almost daily basis.  The Department continue to update the public on measurers that it will continue to introduce working together with other government departments and social partners.</td>
