What made Korea’s approach successful is regulatory flexibility that allowed innovative measures such as emergency approval (limited but prompt approval of production, sale and use of testing kits) and Drive-Thru testing.</td>

We expect by then that there will be a cure or much scientific information about the medicine that will alleviate the symptoms. Researchers and health personnel must work focused on that, taking into account the differences of our population with other countries -genetically and in terms of resources, the geographical challenges our indigenous population face in terms of health care access, to mention some.</td>

We have therefore not consulted widely within various agencies responsible for managing the COVID response.</td>
