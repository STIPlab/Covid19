Australia,2020-04-02 09:11:20.000,"Health policy development and decision making in Australia is governed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (https://www.health.gov.au/committees-and-groups/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc), which is comprised of the Chief Health Officers of each state and territory and chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of the Australian Government Department of Health. In turn, the AHPPC is advised by its expert standing committees specialising in laboratory testing and public health, among other specialist health related subjects. 

Advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the Australian regulator of medicines and medical devices, is provided on a regular basis to the Department of Health and Department of Industry, Science, energy and Resources.","The Australian Government Department of Health contains the National Incident Room, which is a designated National Focal Point under the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) (https://www.who.int/ihr/publications/9789241580496/en/) . The National Incident Room has been sharing information on Australian testing protocols and response measures through the IHR mechanism to assist with the consideration and development of international capacity building for COVID-19 response. 

Australia’s Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, has been taking part in regular teleconferences with international Chief Scientific Advisers to share information and coordinate actions as required.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) participates in regular teleconferences and shares information under existing confidential sharing arrangements with comparable overseas regulators including USFDA, Health Canada, UK MHRA, and WHO.

National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) funds a Centre of Research Excellence dedicated to emergency infectious disease response – The Australian Partnership for Preparedness Research on Infectious Disease Emergencies (APPRISE) which involves many of Australia’s leading infectious disease researchers, epidemiologists, clinicians etc. APPRISE researchers are well integrated into national committees and international research collaborations and networks that are important in a major infectious disease outbreak. See https://www.apprise.org.au/

NHMRC is also a member of the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), an international network of major research funding organizations which invest in research capacity and capabilities to support the rapid initiation of scientific research in case of an outbreak.
","The Australian Government Department of Health has a COVID-19 communications strategy which supports the provision of evidence based advice to the public on an ongoing basis. Communication methods include but are not limited to: a web-based resource hub (https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-resources) , social media posts and targeted advertisements, paid broadcasts on television, and consistent public messages disseminated by senior Australian Government representatives. In particular, there is a ‘frequently asked questions’ (https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-frequently-asked-questions) resource that is updated frequently to help inform the Australian community and refute misleading information.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is publishing media releases, safety advisories and other information on its website to refute misleading information, where required. These statements are also promoted via our social media channels including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram.

OECD Secretariat additions (30 March 2020):
The Australian Government has developed a website (https://www.australia.gov.au/) to provide the latest Coronavirus news, updates and advice from government agencies across Australia, and implemented a WhatsApp chat. The government also has created an official government “Coronavirus Australia” app allowing citizens to be up to date with the official information and advice. 
","The Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN), a standing committee of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), is Australia’s leading network of expert microbiologists. This group is comprised of public health laboratory representatives from each state and territory of Australia. They meet weekly to provide advice, share information and support other laboratories, such as hospital, community and private pathology providers, when issues arise. So far, the Australian Government has funded or will fund the following R&D initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

- $15 million to fast-track research into treatments from the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) (https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/fast-tracking-research-into-treatments-for-covid-19) via three open competitive grant opportunities: 
o $8 million to identify and develop antiviral therapies for people infected with COVID-19 ($3 million will initially be provided to test up to 10 antiviral therapies to test proof of concept; a further $5 million then available for rapid advancement of the most promising candidates).
o $5 million for clinical trials to better treat and manage COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress. 
o $2 million to support research into development of a vaccine to protect against novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

- More than $2.6 million in cutting-edge diagnostics research at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. (https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/26-million-for-coronavirus-research-including-a-new-simpler-australian-pathology-test)

On 22 March 2020, a funding injection of up to $17 million (https://stories.uq.edu.au/news/2020/17m-shot-in-the-arm-for-uq-covid-19-vaccine-research/index.html) was announced for vital University of Queensland research that could help cut the timeline for an effective vaccine for COVID-19 by six months:
• the Queensland Government will allocate $10 million
• the Australian Government has pledged $3 million to the project led by UQ’s School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences. 
• the Paul Ramsay Foundation has provided a grant of $3.5 million to the University of Queensland, conditional upon the University of Queensland securing another $6.5 million to reach a total of $20 million from government and other sources.

The Australian Government will invest $30 million for COVID–19 research to enable Australian researchers to contribute to global efforts to control the outbreak. Three research areas, in line with the priorities agreed at the recent Coronavirus Research Roundtable, are vaccine development, anti-viral development and respiratory medicine research

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is fast tracking (i.e. accelerating) regulatory assessment for applications for a therapeutic good related to COVID-19. In some cases, for example point of care tests, due to limited information at the time of application, regulatory approval is granted, with strict conditions that follow-up data and studies including stability shelf-life is provided to the TGA.  In addition, a number of exemptions for complying with normal regulatory processes and approvals are in place to facilitate faster access and supply for some tests and PPE medical devices. 
• Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices—Accredited Pathology Laboratories) (COVID-19 Emergency) Exemption 2020 (F2020N00032);(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00032/Download)  and
• Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices—Face Masks and Other Articles) (COVID-19 Emergency) Exemption 2020 (F2020N00033).(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00033/Download) 

See: https://www.tga.gov.au/legal-supply-covid-19-diagnostic-tests

The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) funds a Centre of Research Excellence dedicated to emergency pandemic response – the Australian Partnership for Preparedness Research on Infectious Disease Emergencies (APPRISE). Funding for this network is AUD$5 million over 5 years from 2016 to 2021 (see: https://www.apprise.org.au/). APPRISE is supporting 16 urgent research projects covering areas such as diagnostics, treatment and communication in response to COVID-19. It is joining forces with the NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence in Emerging Infectious Diseases (CREID), to support the national collaborative projects designed to fill areas of critical research need and improve Australia’s emergency response to COVID-19. 
","The Australian Government draws on the expertise of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN) and the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA), through its established decision making governance mechanism. These committees can draw on academic, industry and other stakeholder expertise to inform response measures for COVID-19 and other health emergencies of national concern. The Emergency Response Plan for Communicable Disease Incidents of National Significance: National Arrangements (National CD Plan) (https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-nat-CD-plan.htm)  and the National Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/australian-health-sector-emergency-response-plan-for-novel-coronavirus-covid-19)  outline the response roles and responsibilities of Federal, state, territory and local governments, including engagement with different STI actors, to collaborate on responses to COVID-19. 

The Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) is a specific initiative that engages STI organisations. The MRFF is a research fund set up by the Australian Government in 2015 that provides funding to four overall research themes, focused on patients, researchers, research missions and research translation. There are currently three MRFF grant opportunities open for COVID-19 related activities.
","The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is Australia’s national science research agency. CSIRO has received funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global group that aims to speed up the development of vaccines and cut short the COVID-19 pandemic. CSIRO will receive vaccine candidates agreed by CEPI and begin testing of new potential vaccines and therapeutics to see if they work and are safe. The vaccine developments themselves are being partially funded by CEPI in laboratories around the world including Australia. CSIRO is working closely with the University of Queensland and the Doherty Institute.

CSIRO is also part of a separate consortium established with the University of Queensland in 2019 to rapidly develop vaccines. The consortium was established to create a rapid response pipeline to develop and test new vaccines. The consortium has been tasked by CEPI to develop a vaccine platform for nCoV-2019 in collaboration with CSIRO. ","The Australian Government is investing more than $2.6 million in cutting-edge diagnostics research by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, this will be directed to four strategies, including:  
• A 'one-step' nucleic acid detection, which combines the current extraction of the virus from the patient sample and detection step into one. By avoiding the separate extraction of genetic material, this test saves substantially on critical lab consumables and is also very rapid, with the potential to reduce test turnaround times.
• The development of new testing protocols to enable more individuals to be tested simultaneously, while minimising the number of consumables used and maintain the current turnaround times.
• Rapidly assessing, trialing, and where relevant, validating new diagnostic test kits to ensure they are of the highest quality.
• Assessing how and when to use serology testing. Serology testing could assist with identification of asymptomatic infection, retrospective diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from infection and determining the extent of infection in a population.
","Over recent weeks, requests for COVID-19 testing have increased, as have demands on pathology supplies. It is expected that similar pressures are occurring worldwide due to the increased demand for testing. However, there are sufficient stocks within the Australian laboratory system to meet the current demand. The Australian Government is working closely with public and private laboratories, as well as manufacturers, to secure pathology supplies so that testing capacity can be sustained throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. ",The Australian Government is working closely with laboratories to ensure that Australia maintains the capacity and capability to test for COVID-19.,
Austria,2020-04-03 10:14:52.000,"Austrian research institutions and universities, for example the Austrian Academy of Sciences (OeAW) and the Medical Universities, are regularly consulting policy makers from government institutions and the parliament. Offering their expertise to official decision makers is a part of their legal obligations.

Relevant researchers are also included in the crisis consulting boards. For example: Austrian Federal Ministry of Health “Coronavirus Taskforce”, which provides medical and scientific advice - see 
https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Coronavirus---Taskforce.html
","The responses are coordinated by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research. The focus of international coordination lies within the European Union and is based on regular video conferences between the European Commission and Member States at Directorate-General level.

As a result of these coordination efforts, an “R&I Action Plan for ‘ERAvsCorona’"" is about to be finalised.
","Government authorities aim to inform the public through official channels on ongoing scientific developments on a very regular basis.

The Federal Chancellery established a “digital crisis unit”, which deals with the detection and correction of incorrect information about Covid-19.

The public television channels, as well as private networks, are widely covering scientific developments in their news shows. At the same time special television shows have been aired that offer scientists the opportunity to provide relevant advice and information to a larger public.
","A dedicated Joint Call for COVID-19 with a volume of € 21 Mio. from the two Austrian Federal Ministries,the Ministry of Digitalisation and Economy together with the Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Mobility, Innovation and Technology  was launched in March to support applied research on tests, vaccines and medication against COVID-19 Mio. See https://www.ffg.at/ausschreibung/emergencycall-covid-19. The Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research is supporting its Medical Universities to participate in medical trials with an extra € 2 Mio.

The Austrian Science Fund (FWF) has introduced fast track approval for COVID-19 relevant research.

The Austrian authorities treat all applications for medical trials preferentially in order to grant approval as fast as possible.

Additionally,  Austrian research groups successfully participate in the special Horizon 2020 call at the European level.
","The funding calls mentioned under Q3 are open for joint proposals. They aim at furthering close collaboration and address possible synergies between universities and research institutions, both from the academic and private sector, which we are already registering throughout the Austrian STI system.

We are currently aiming at establishing additional platforms on a national level to better coordinate relevant initiatives.
","The Austrian universities and research institutions are organised in multiple international platforms, such as, for example, the European Academy of Sciences (EurASc), the European university networks, or transnational initiatives such as CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations).

EMBL-EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute) has started to work with interested Member States to establish data hubs that can serve as a forum for data sharing among virologists from all over the world.

A current challenge is to step up our efforts in coordinating all these initiatives in order to create critical mass and to avoid unnecessary duplication.

Via the Horizon 2020 Health Programme Committee, a list of the 8 most urgent research fields related to COVID-19 from GLOPID-R (Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Prevention) and the WHO has been distributed. This list could form the basis for a coordinated action in Europe.
","In Austria, there are currently numerous initiatives, both from the public and private sector, aiming at providing rapid tests, medication and vaccination. Many of those are embedded in international and European partnerships. The initiatives range from academic spin-offs using AI technology to identify agents, big data analysis on the spread of COVID-19 nationally and internationally, university networks manufacturing sanitiser through novel methods, to the social sciences addressing and supporting the current societal challenges. Since the already significant number is constantly growing, providing a representative overview is impossible at the current time.

To name one of the above mentioned initiatives, the Complexity Science Hub Vienna (CSH) has offered new calculations with regard to possible scenarios for the spread of Covid-19. Their publication is offered with the suggestion to base all predictions regarding the duration of the measures issued by the Austrian government on patients in intensive care units and deaths, rather than on infection numbers. 

Another initiative that offers advice on the duration of those measures is a research team from the Technical University in Vienna and one of its spin-off companies. They published a simulation calculation that asks to keep the measures issued in place, but that from a scientific point of view at the current time, more restrictions for the general public are unlikely to have an impact. Therefore, additional measures should put their focus on targeted risk groups. ","The corona crisis will only be solved with the aid of research and innovation. This has been stressed by members of the Austrian government in a joint press statement on March 21st 2020. The corona crisis is a time in which the government, and especially society, strongly rely on the expertise of and support from the STI-system all around the globe. What is currently witnessed is a rapid engagement across disciplines and nationalities of researchers from all institutions to jointly battle the crisis. In times like this, the significance of R&D and its direct impact on all our lives becomes more evident than ever. 

At this point in time, it seems premature to describe the impacts of the Corona pandemic on the STI system in more detail.
","Besides the support measures mentioned in answer to Q3, the Austrian government plans to provide a €38 billion support package for the domestic economy. Within this package, many R&D oriented companies and research institutions are going to be supported. However, it is currently not planned to invest that money in the STI system.",All efforts by the OECD to foster collaboration and exchange of experience among its members are most welcome.
Belgium,2020-05-13 14:38:52.000,"The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) require each Member State to have a structure capable of dealing with any health crisis. To this end, Belgium has set up a strong structure with three components: a Risk Assessment Group (RAG); a Risk Management Group (RMG) and; the National Focal Point (NFP). The RAG conducts public health risk assessments based on epidemiological and scientific data and is composed of experts from the health authorities and Sciensano (a federal research institution which is the leading scientific institution in the epidemiology of infectious diseases); the RMG takes action to protect public health based on the work of the RAG. A special scientific committee was also convened to advise the authorities on the latest scientific developments, so as to assure the swift elaboration of any necessary measures.
","The Belgian government is in constant contact with the World Health Organization and European Union for the latest news and recommendations.

At European level, Belgium provides input and feedback on R&I needs via different fora, such as the EU Horizon 2020 SC1 Health, Wellbeing Programme Committee. 
","Concerning science advice, Belgium's daily briefing to citizens is (as the British newspaper ""Financial Times"" described it) ""fronted not by politicians, but by scientific experts and spokespeople of the Belgium government’s crisis centre"". Those briefings are also used to clarify misunderstandings and to fight back attempts to deviate from the lockdown conditions and rumours. 

Concerning misinformation, Belgium, through its Centre for Cybersecurity, tries to alert people against misleading communication about the coronavirus and provides links to Belgian sites where official reports are available. The Centre has also developed some tools, like an online test to see if you can recognise phishing (see https://www.safeonweb.be/en/quiz/phishing-test). 

At regional level, there are also important initiatives; e.g.: the Flemish agency of Care and Health (agentschap Zorg en gezondheid) has created a dedicated fact checking webpage on its ‘health and science’ website (https://www.gezondheidenwetenschap.be/dossiers/coronavirus) to help debunk fake news on COVID-19.
","Flanders regional measures: https://stiplab.github.io/Covid19/files/innovation_in_flanders_to_combat_the_sars-cov-2_virus_or_its_derived_effects_-_11_may_2020.pdf
Wallonia regional measures: http://stiplab.github.io/Covid19/files/2020-05-08_COVID-19_-_Cadastre_RI_COVID19_EN.pdf

In the last two weeks, we have seen in Belgium numerous initiatives to respond to the Covid-19 crisis. However, these are mainly bottom-up. Everywhere around the country, research groups in all universities and in research centres, as well as in companies, have reallocated budgets to address different issues. 

One example is the case of the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) that announced the reallocation of about 1 million Euro of its budgets for its Grand Challenges Programme to COVID-19 projects.

In the region of Wallonia, the BioWin cluster (active in the field of health biotechnology and medical technologies) has developed an interactive platform for centralization of health initiatives related to COVID-19 around 6 urgent themes: manufacturing, supply and recycling of masks for companies; development and repair of ventilators; development and manufacturing of hydroalcoholic gels; development and manufacturing of new diagnostic approaches; development of new treatments; and new sources of funding  (https://www.biowin.org/en/news/covid-19-join-biowins-cooperation-platform).

Another example is the case of ITM (Institute of Tropical Medicine) experts who joined colleagues of the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) to set up an epidemiological database. 

Also the Young Academy (an interdisciplinary and inter-university group of top young researchers and artists in Flanders) launched a number of initiatives to join forces among scientists from all disciplines, including coordination on the production of ventilation equipment and the collection of initiatives in a Slack-environment for scientists.
","Belgium is putting scientific expertise at the service of public health. An example is the case of the specialised physicians of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp (ITM) who recently strengthened the Antwerp University Hospital in the screening and treatment of COVID-19 patients as they are experienced in working with infectious diseases. 

Flanders has organised a taskforce to map, align and promote all public and private digital initiatives that aim to keep the world connected during the pandemic https://www.vlaanderen.be/vlaanderen-helemaal-digitaal

A multidisciplinary consortium consisting of academic researchers, privacy experts and app developers has joined forces to develop a platform to map the further spread of the virus and to better contain the epidemic. The platform combines: a mobile app for citizens; a web app for medical personnel; a back-end for data aggregation; and an AI system to train models. All these components work together to map potential infected clusters, hotspots and super spreading. Contact tracing can furthermore be done more efficiently. Privacy experts have been involved from the outset.

","Belgium is contributing to EU discussions in this area and has participated in a successful way in the recent call for projects launched within the EU R&I framework programme Horizon 2020 (4 out the 17 proposals selected for funding have at least one Belgian participant). Another European initiative in this area is the IMI2 JU call 21 (https://www.imi.europa.eu/apply-funding/open-calls/imi2-call-21).

Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in Belgium are preparing to provide support to African countries with fragile health systems. ITM is monitoring the situation closely and is in touch with its partner countries in Africa. The Institute is available to support public health responses and is considering studies to better understand the possible spread of the virus in these countries.
","There is an increased demand for open science initiatives and a positive response to that demand.

The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) provides computing time for research on Covid-19 both for academics and companies. More information can be found at www.vscentrum.be/covid19.

In Belgium, as in most countries, postdoc evaluations are normally face-to-face, but that cannot be done for the moment. As a consequence, some Belgian universities have already decided to replace face-to-face evaluations with an online expert panel meeting. 

Some Belgian innovators have also seen an opportunity in the negative side effects of social distancing measures. Since queuing and grouping at authorized locations (food stores, pharmacies, hospitals, parks, etc.) may be problematic, the Belgian company Seaters – which normally helps to distribute sponsoring tickets for sports and cultural events – has transformed its product into a Virtual Queuing System. Via that system an appointment voucher for authorized locations can be requested. Each voucher mentions an hour of visit that takes into account the social distancing rules (max. 1 person per 10 m2) and the necessary time per person (max. 30 min. for groceries, for example). The demo version of the platform can be activated nationally in 24 hours.
","In terms of impact, it is clear that many present and future R&I activities (like experiments) are placed on 'hold' (so that resources can be dedicated to the development of a response to the pandemic). This will cause important project delays and may lead, if the current situation is prolonged, to lack of expertise in other S&T areas.
Possible measures some Belgian players are taking include: to make use of the regulatory option to spend means for staff and consumables up to 2 years after the formal end date of the project to finalise the research; to postpone submission deadlines for research proposals; and to invite researchers to indicate in their fellowship reports any problems they encountered due to the coronavirus situation.

Another impact is on Postdoc evaluations. These are normally face-to-face but that cannot happen for the moment.
Measure: reducing the 2-step procedure to a single and online expert panel meeting for the evaluation and ranking of the applications, based on the available evaluation and synthesis reports for the pre-selection step.
",,"Belgium pleads for great international solidarity during this crisis. All possibilities for international aid must be activated.
 
Transparency and exchange of information are essential and existing networks should be used as much as possible such as the Early Warning and Response System (in Europe).

Brazil,2020-04-03 19:00:38.000,"""Rede Vírus-MCTIC - Among the initiatives the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication has carried out to support the fight against Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19), is the creation of an Experts Committee Rede Vírus-MCTIC (Virus-MCTIC Network) on Mar 11th 2020. The idea of creating this Network arose from a meeting held in early February 2020, with the aim of promoting a technical discussion of how science can help Brazil in tackling the problem of emerging viruses, especially the coronavirus. Scientists specialized in the area and representatives from the Ministry of Health participated in the debate. The Virus-MCTIC Network is already working to assist the Government in initial RD&I actions to face this pandemic, as well as in the definition of research priorities related to COVID-19.

The Network plans to use MCTIC Research Units as CERTIFIERS for local producers so that they can manufacture materials to combat COVID-19. These Research Units are spread across Brazil and can respect the distinct nature of Brazilian regions, enabling the use of local sanitizing products, such as alcohol, detergents, masks, moist towels, etc.""

The Ministry of Health of Brazil is also monitoring the situation and establishing protocols and guidelines to deal with the pandemic. The Ministry of Health is in frequent contact with the World Health Organization and with local officials, politicians, medical personal and researchers in order to have the best information available to guide national policy. ","The Brazilian Minister of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications, Marcos Pontes, is representing Brazil in a working group established between high level officials such as Ministers and Chief Scientific Advisers from the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and USA. The objective of this working group is to share research results and information on how science can assist in the decisions and measures that governments are taking to face the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Minister Pontes is also actively participating at the consulting group on scientific responses to CV19 established by UNESCO.
And of course the Brazilian Delegation, with the assistance of the Brazilian scientific community, has been actively involved in the debate on public policies informed by science in the context of WHO. ","The Minister of Health of Brazil has organized meetings with municipal authorities as well as State Governors in order to coordinate response and to provide the best information to the public. Several of these meetings have been led at Presidential level. The Minister Chief of Staff of the Presidency (« Casa Civil ») has also been charged by the President with coordinating a whole-of-government response, involving with all the relevant Ministries, including those responsible for Health, Science and Technology, Economy and social services (« Cidadania »). There are regular meetings with the press to inform the public of the latest developments of the pandemic in Brazil and the official response. The Ministry of Health has published a webpage to bring information to the public (http://coronavirus.saude.gov.br/) and has developed an app (CoronavirusSUS available for IOS and Android systems) which conveys information and advices citizens to take the correct actions (such as searching the closest health center) based on self-evaluation of their health conditions.

Fiocruz, a state-owned foundation and laboratory that engages in research and development of  biotechnology products, has launched the COVID-19 Information for Researchers web page in order to grant access for researchers to scientific and technical publications, situational maps and epidemiological reports (https://portal.fiocruz.br/coronavirus-2019-ncov-informacoes-para-pesquisadores-0). There is also a podcast to provide information for the general public - https://open.spotify.com/show/4JDOjmiNfSoSE5fvExqNNs. ","The Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications of Brazil (MCTIC) established an advisory committee and strategic plan to provide coordinated and quick responses to emerging viruses. This ""Virus-MCTIC Network"" coordinates the efforts of research laboratories with a view to identifying complementarities of infrastructure and activities in the ongoing research on Covid-19, influenza and others. The objectives of the network are the integration of scientific research and development efforts in the area of emerging viruses; definition of research priorities; coordination of ongoing R,D&I initiatives related to emerging viruses; and development of technologies to assist the country in facing those challenges. Researchers and representatives of MCTIC, the Ministry of Health and development agencies participate in the initiative.  

As an example, within this network, the National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM) is already employing tools like computational biology and AI to evaluate the effectiveness of about 2 thousand existing drugs against Covid-19. Computational data tests use atomic structure data and the behavior of Covid-19 proteins to examine the interaction of molecules of available medications with these target proteins, and to pre-select those that show promise in interfering with the infection. Selected molecules will then be tested in vitro to verify its effectiveness in eliminating the virus, which will allow the new use of already available medications. 

The emergency release of R$ 3.4 billion (around USD 700 million) to be used in initiatives to fight the pandemic has recently been approved by the Federal government. The funds will be allocated to the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Defense; and Ministry of Citizenship.From that amount, R$ 100 million (around USD 20 million) will be directed to STI measures, from the National Scientific and Technological Development Fund (FNDCT), to be applied in Research Networks, National Institutes of Science and Technology (INCT) and public calls via the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Funding for Studies and Projects Agency (Finep) 

The funds will be used for emergency support of projects (grants) within the scope of the priorities defined by the Virus-MCTIC Network, including: - Development of diagnostic kits; - Development of vaccines; - Use of advanced technologies for rapid selection of possible drugs; - Large-scale sequencing and monitoring of mutations in SARS-Cov 2 (COVID-19) samples; - Structuring a virus sample bank for scientific studies to understand the disease. 

The State National Postal Service Company (Correios) is acting as the logistics partner for the Virus-MCTIC Network, being responsible for collecting viral material (new coronavirus and influenza) from selected laboratories and delivering them to other labs (in-kind contribution). These are being used in studies on contagion, proliferation of viruses and vaccines for diseases. Scientists working on the matter now have priority in receiving and sending research material, since time is crucial for the effectiveness of research with COVID-19. 

A research call for projects has already been launched on the total of R$ 50 million (around USD 10 million) by CNPq. The call is aimed at projects on diagnosis, vaccines, clinical trials and other research related to the virus. Overall priority is given to the development of a) medications and respective pre-clinical and clinical tests; b) vaccines and respective pre-clinical and clinical tests; c) innovation for the production in large scale of ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) and their related systems; Research, development and innovation in diagnostic tests are also a priority; monitoring and sequencing the virus genome circulating in the country; telemedicine tools.  

The Ministry of Health has authorized the use of telemedicine to care for patients with coronavirus (March 23rd, 2020). To this end, the MCTIC will carry out: I - direct contracting of projects, studies, technologies and innovations; II - public call (s) for contracting projects, studies, technologies and innovations; and III - coordination between organizations in the science, technology, innovation and communications system. 

MCTIC has also launched 7 orders for technology acquisition on the total amount of R$ 50 million (around USD 10 million). They include development of products for genetic sequencing, clinical trials protocol, the application of AI on inhibiting virus replication, development of test kits and vaccines as well as social projects. 

Another initiative by MCTIC is the launch of the platform IdearuMCTIC (www.mctic.gov.br), aimed at connecting ideas and evaluating the maturity of technological solutions related to the challenges imposed by the pandemic. 

Besides that, funding State agencies such as FAPESP (State of São Paulo), Fundação Araucária (State of Paraná) and FAPERJ (State of Rio de Janeiro), as well as funding federal agencies such as CAPES (Ministry of Education), are releasing funds for research on tackling the challenges caused by the pandemic, such as the development of tests or vaccines, as well as the genomic sequencing of the virus. Other entities like EMBRAPII (Brazilian Industrial Research and Innovation Company), SEBRAE (Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Agency), and Porto Digital (Science park located at the State of Pernambuco) are taking efforts for innovative solutions to be developed, such as the fabrication of ventilators and of tests for diagnosis of COVID-19. 

The São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) launched a call for research proposals on COVID-19 within the time limit of 24 months, with a view to understanding the virus` epidemiological characteristics, developing tests and therapies, conducting research on clinical procedures, identifying and evaluating innate immune responses and issues related to the social behavior of the affected population. The total amount of the research call is R$ 10 million (around USD 2 million). 

FAPESP and FINEP, under the PIPE/PAPPE Grant Program, launched a call for research projects on the development of technologies for products, services and processes to fight Covid-19. The research call will allow that participants from previous phases of the Grant program (Phase 1 or Phase 2) to commercialize emergency products or services.  

Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Agency (SEBRAE) will assign R$ 2 million (around USD 400 thousand) to the development of technological solutions by startups and other small and medium-sized enterprises with a view to help the Brazil face Covid-19. The funds will add up to R$ 4 million (around USD 800 thousand) from the Brazilian Industrial Research and Innovation Company (EMBRAPII) and contributions by participating companies and accredited research and innovation centers. Joint resources are expected to reach the total of R$ 10 million (around USD 2 million). The resources may be used for software development, system devices, hardware, medical parts and equipment, and others. 

EMBRAPII has also approved R$ 2.3 million (USD 900 thousand) to the development of mechanical ventilators, that provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide directly from the blood.  

The National Service for Industrial Training (SENAI), through the ""Innovation Call for Industry"", will select projects that help prevent, diagnose and treat Covid-19. It foresees the destination of R$ 10 million (around USD 2 million) for proposals on solutions against problems caused by the virus, with immediate application and results within 40 days, in the areas of consulting, metrology, testing, analysis, research, development and innovation. Examples of these solutions are the manufacture of mechanical respirators and the development of rapid tests for the detection the disease. 

The National Council of State Foundations of Research Support (CONFAP) released a proposal for Brazilian institutions to join the so-called ""Development of therapy and diagnosis for fighting coronavirus infections"" launched by `Innovative Medicines Initiative`, in cooperation with European Union and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). Its objective is to identify new therapeutic agents, early diagnostic systems, and reliable data related to Covid-19. Brazilian partners can participate in a co-financing scheme. The European side plans to disburse EUR 45 million. 

The University of São Paulo (USP) is conducting researches for vaccine development with a quick response against the virus. The work takes advantage of results from previous studies on other types of coronaviruses, which, hopefully, can help in the case of Covid-19. Brazilian research is comparatively safer, as it is based on the creation of a particle similar to coronavirus, the VLP (virus-like particle), equivalent to a hollow virus, without the genetic material and therefore without the transmissibility of the disease.  

The Covid Challenge 19 is an initiative by the Public Persecutor`s Office of the State of Pernambuco (MPPE), the State Health Secretariat of Pernambuco (SES-PE) and Porto Digital. The MPPE and SES-PE offer R$ 1.3 million for innovative and high-impact solutions that can be adopted in a short term, with a view to fighting the virus. The challenge already includes the submission of 543 ideas on 5 areas: a) monitoring the risk groups; b) information flow management; c) monitoring social isolation; d) support for health agents; and e) testing and diagnosis. 
","Brazil is taking expedient measures to respond to the crises. As early as January, the Ministry of Health created an emergency group to monitor the situation, head by the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). In February, the Health Ministry organized a meeting with Secretaries of Health from municipalities and state-level in order to coordinate responses to the coming crises, before there were any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil, and also published the National Contingency Plan for the COVID-19 crises (https://portalarquivos2.saude.gov.br/images/pdf/2020/ marco/25/Livreto-Plano-de-Contingencia-5-Corona2020-21 0x297-16mar.pdf), which organizes the actions to be taken during the development of the pandemic in Brazil, describing levels of response and assigning attributions for different actors. 

Once the pandemic reached Brazil, a crisis committee, head by the office of the Chief of Staff of the Presidency (Casa Civil) was established in order to discuss measures to be taken on a whole-of-government level. Then, an interministerial committee was created, gathering the highest officials from the Federal Government to meet with the President in order to coordinate policy. The meetings include ministers of Foreign Affairs; Defense; Health; Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications; Economy; and others. 
","Fiocruz and the Ministry of Health are developing joint actions with the World Health Organization in order to respond to the crises. Brazilian authorities also take part in meetings with political leaders that are part of multilateral mechanisms such as Prosul (South America) and G20 aimed at coordinating actions. 
As mentioned above, (1.B), the Minister of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications is also articulating with foreign counterparts actions to be taken to tackle the pandemic. 
","Artificial Intelligence, Biocomputing and high performance computing are being applied to develop research and new products. Brazilian infrastructures like CNPEN laboratories and the Santos Dumont and Ogbon Super Computers are part of the Folding@Home project, which donates computing power to run simulations and research. 

Using the Santos Dumont supercomputer Brazilian researchers have sequenced 19 genomes from the COVID-19 variations present in Brazil in just 48 hours. It was possible to identify from which countries and regions of the world came the different strains of COVID-19 that reached Brazil. 

Also, the call for proposals being launched with the extraordinary credit, mentioned above (Q.3), includes support for projects for large scale sequencing of viruses, use of advanced technologies (eg. AI) for medicine selection and support of clinical trials, support for advanced vaccine development platforms (eg. VLP) & Data Science projects for modeling and planning. 
","SFor the short term: 
- Loss of important human capital - Median age for researchers is typically higher than the general workforce - depending on the severity of the crisis; 
- Disruption of ongoing research projects which require physical access to labs, other research facilities or medical facilities;
- Postponement of conferences.
 For the medium term:
- Higher public understanding on the importance of R&D;
- Higher reliance and confidence on remote work and collaboration arrangements, both for Research and work in general;
- Higher perception on the importance of access to scientific information and resources (articles, data, etc)
- Better availability of FAIR research data. 
- The improvement of coordination among different
agents of the STI ecosystem and development of capacity for quick response to immediate threat. 
For the long Term:
- Higher focus on health-related research.
- An increase on the public perception as of the importance to invest in STI.","Yes. As explained above (Q.3), the Federal Government has released R$ 3.4 billion to tackle the challenges of the pandemic, of which R$ 3 billion will be directed to social benefits. On what concerns STI, R$100 million have already being authorized to be invested in research and innovation.  
Other federal economic stimulus packages might also help indirectly the STI system, since they are aimed at provided liquidity to the financial sector (banks) in order to facilitate credit to small and medium enterprises and alleviating tax obligations. 
","Adding to the public sector effort, private enterprises are also engaged in fighting the pandemic. Big companies like the aircraft manufacture Embraer are adapting plants to the fabrication of mechanical ventilators and its components. Startup companies are also developing new products, like 3D printed ventilators and masks, as well as new test kits. They have also offered services like delivery of donations and geolocalization apps to help with the mapping the geographic distribution of the virus.  
The startup Hi Technologies, based in Curitiba, State of Parana, announced the development of a rapid test for Covid-19 detection that provides results in 10 minutes. The large-scale production of the test kit is underway, with delivery of kits in April. The startup is known for the Hilab device, which integrates internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence to perform remote exams by collecting drops of blood in the Hilab (available in pharmacies), that transmits information to the laboratory responsible for analyzing the result, issuing and signing the respective report. Hilab is already capable of testing for HIV, dengue, zika and hepatitis, in addition to measuring cholesterol levels, blood glucose and other issues.  
Governments across Brazil are looking to roll out a system developed that uses geolocation tracking to support actions around the lockdowns intended to slow the spread of COVID-19. Brazilian startup InLoco develops the geolocation technology, which is normally used by companies from sectors such as retail, to securely target and engage with users without the need to share personal information. Users are geotracked through a location map that does not use GPS or beacons, which InLoco claims to be 30 times more accurate than GPS. The startup is headquartered at Porto Digital, a technology innovation cluster in the northeastern city of Recife, where the platform has gone live last weekend. Announcing the measures, the mayor of Recife said the city is tracking at least 700.000 smartphones to identify where the lockdown rules are being followed - many Brazilians, particularly those in vulnerable sections of society, have no choice but continue to work despite the risk. 
The Governance & New Economy Community (Gonew.co), with the support from the Brazilian Association of Startups (Abstartups), launched the campaign StartupsxCovid19, which seeks to map companies with innovative solutions to face the coronavirus crisis. Among other initiatives, mapping will be used to provide information to entities such as the Ministry of Health. 
"
Canada,2020-05-08 18:29:03.000,"The Prime Minister and Cabinet are responsible for national policy-making in areas of federal jurisdiction which include public health emergencies, controlling infectious disease, regulation of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, international travel and immigration, employment and workforce, industry, and scientific research.  In response to the pandemic, a Cabinet Committee on the federal response to the coronavirus disease was struck; it is chaired by the Prime Minister.

Canada’s Chief Science Advisor (CSA) provides and coordinates expert advice to the Prime Minister and members of Cabinet, as appropriate and as requested, on key scientific issues. In the context of COVID-19, the CSA assembled a panel of experts to assist her in providing rapid access to biomedical expertise ensuring science is available to inform national policies and decisions. https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_98013.html. 

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) monitors and responds to disease outbreaks. PHAC, through Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO), advises the Government of Canada and Canadians on the steps they should take to protect their health, working in close collaboration with the chief medical officers of health in the provinces and territories.  

The Government Operations Centre (GOC) coordinates and gathers information across the national and sub-national levels of government to ensure a national picture. For emergencies that pose a risk to public health, PHAC activates the Health Portfolio Operations Centre (HPOC), which ensures effective planning and coordination of the Agency's response efforts, in collaboration with international, federal, provincial, and territorial partners. The HPOC employs an emergency response structure modelled after the international recommended practices of the Incident Management System (IMS) framework that contains a number of coordinating functions, including research and emerging science, testing, and medical countermeasures.

During a public health response, the federal, provincial and territorial governments work collaboratively to establish an overall agreed upon strategy, as per Canada’s Public Health Response Plan for Biological Events (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/emergency-preparedness/public-health-response-plan-biological-events.html). Strategies may include interventions such as: developing/modifying protocols for surveillance and laboratory testing, providing recommendations for public health measures and the use of medical countermeasures, identifying research needs and developing and implementing communication strategies that allows F/P/T governments to develop harmonized communication plans and stakeholder engagement strategies.  This is facilitated through the activation of a number of governance structures, for instance:
o A Special Advisory Committee (SAC) on novel coronavirus, composed of the CPHO and the chief public health officers in the provinces and territories.  The SAC has the mandate to provide advice to the F/P/T Conference of Deputy Ministers of Health (CDMH). 
o A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) reviews and approves technical products prior to them going to SAC. 

In addition to public health, officials in other federal government agencies have set up regular calls with their provincial-territorial counterparts to discuss science-related issues that inform policies.  For instance, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) and the provincial government ministries responsible for science and research  discuss ways to better coordinate the provincial initiatives  with those being undertaken at the federal level.  Food safety and security issues are also being discussed among various agencies and industry. 
","At the international level, Canada joins other G7 countries in sharing information and providing scientific expertise and leadership to accelerate research efforts. Government agencies (Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), Health Canada (HC), Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and the National Research Council (NRC)) are working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to enhance global coordination, support transparent global research, enable priority setting, and build common research platforms. Canada's Chief Science Advisor, Dr. Mona Nemer, is in regular contact with the chief science advisors of various countries to exchange information and mobilize global research approaches regarding the COVID-19 response. To help advance research and vaccine development for COVID-19, Canada is participating in the international collaboration, coordinated by the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
o Canada, through CIHR and the International Development Research Centre, is a member of the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), a consortium of funders that facilitates the international rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19. CIHR's Scientific Director of the Institute of Immunity and Infection is a Vice-Chair of GloPID-R. Canada continues to work with international partners through the GloPID-R and the WHO's R&D Blueprint to leverage global efforts and avoid duplicative activities. CIHR is one of 67 international research funders that are signatories to a statement to rapidly and openly share COVID-19 research data and findings. 
o Canada is participating in the WHO's SOLIDARITY trial, a multi-national clinical trial to study possible treatment options for COVID-19. The goal is to rapidly generate robust data with the same study protocol applied to multiple sites in order to obtain sufficient numbers of patients enrolled in the clinical trial to ensure statistically sound results. Over 70 countries have now confirmed participation. Canada has invested nearly $1 million through the CIHR to support the Canadian arm of this trial. 
o The CFIA, in partnership with Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) and PHAC, established the Biosafety Level 4 Zoonotic Disease Network (BSL4ZNet) which is a network of 15 government organizations from five different countries (Canada, US, UK, Germany and Australia), each with a responsibility over the regulation of human, animal and zoonotic pathogens with pandemic potential. The BSL4ZNet has been conducting COVID-19 emergency meetings since early January with international partners to facilitate the sharing of scientific information and research capacity needs in a secure and trusted platform. Technical points of contact on COVID-19 research from Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States and Canada represented by the BSL4ZNet secretariat have been sharing updates on research priorities and progress. The CFIA has also contributed knowledge towards the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) risk assessments of COVID-19 on its zoonotic potential and in identifying priority research needs on host pathogen interactions.
o NRC, PHAC and CFIA regularly engage with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI), which is a key international funding mechanism for vaccine development. Canada has also provided $14 million to CEPI, which is leading efforts to have COVID-19 vaccine candidates ready for clinical trials by late spring. 
o HC is engaged with other international regulators to monitor any impacts on the global supply of medicines as a member of the International Pharmaceutical Regulators Programme. PHAC and DRDC are members of the Medical Countermeasures Consortium, in partnership with the Department of National Defence, where they engage with the US, UK and Australian governments to promote collaboration in research, development and acquisition. 
o In addition, research information is being shared between the 27 regulatory authorities, representing every region in the world, that make up the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities.

On May 4, the Government of Canada announced its commitment to co-chair the Coronavirus Global Response initiative (CGRI) with Saudi Arabia in their current G20 presidency role, and Italy in their future G20 presidency role. Other co-chair partners include the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Japan. The CGRI seeks to kick-start an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organizations, foundations, and health care professionals. It is hoped that together they can raise more than $8 billion (USD) by the end of the pledging period to support the development of rapid coronavirus diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines. The partners will also work with the World Health Organization to coordinate and prioritize efforts to vulnerable countries. The funds collected will be channelled into three principal strands: diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines and may also be used to strengthen health systems.
","The Government of Canada has undertaken significant communications and public education on COVID-19 to inform Canadians of the Government's action, to help them make informed decisions and to enable them to take action to protect their health and their communities. Canadians have access to information, updated daily, through:
o The Canada.ca/coronavirus website, which includes information resources that Canadians can download on the novel coronavirus, how to be prepared and how to limit the spread of the virus.
o The Government of Canada's coronavirus information line (1-833-784-4397), where  members of the community can speak with a public health officials in either French or English to address their questions. This service is available from 7:00 a.m. to midnight (EST) seven days a week.
o Regular briefings and information sharing by Canada's Chief Public Health Officer and federal cabinet ministers, including multiple Government of Canada social media accounts. 
o The Prime Minister provides regular press briefings at 11:00 am almost every morning where he shares the latest information with Canadians. He has been conducting regular briefings since mid-March. 
o Government of Canada commercials to remind Canadians of the importance of staying home to protect themselves and those around them. Printed materials sent to every household in Canada on proper hygiene and what to do if they suspect they may have COVID-19. 

As the situation evolves, the Government of Canada will expand existing communications and public education to ensure that Canadians can make informed decisions on how best to protect themselves.  To ensure Canadians get trusted and accurate information, the Government of Canada is providing $50 million to the Public Health Agency of Canada's dedicated communications capacity and public education efforts.

Provinces and territories are also communicating science advice to their citizens through daily updates from premiers, ministers and chief medical officers. Municipalities are doing the same through their own medical officers of health, and are providing citizens with more specific locally relevant information.

Canada’s National Security Agencies are taking aggressive measures to quash malicious cyber campaigns seeking to exploit vulnerable Canadians and promoting false and fake information pertaining to the pandemic. For example, the Communications Security Establishment dismantled fake sites posing as official government sites. https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cse-disinformation-spoofing-1.5504619 

On April 7, the Government of Canada invested $3M in several organizations to promote a public awareness tool and on-line workshop to help Canadians become more resilient and think critically about COVID-19 disinformation. 

On April 4, the Government of Canada launched a new COVID-19 situational dashboard for Canada https://phac-aspc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e968bf79f4694b5ab290205e05cfcda6

","A report on Government of Canada's research response to COVID-19 was released on April 23, 2020, which outlines a number of the initiatives below. https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-government-canada-research-response.html

Rapid Research Response to COVID-19: On February 10, 2020, the Government of Canada launched a Rapid Research Funding Opportunity. 
o Result:  99 research projects ($54.2M over 2 years) funded to provide new evidence on how to address COVID-19 in two broad research areas:
1.Medical countermeasures research (e.g., transmission and zoonotic source of the 2019-nCov, development and evaluation of diagnostic tools for early case detection and surveillance, and development and evaluation of candidate vaccines, among other areas) and 
2.Social and policy countermeasures research (e.g., examining how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease, and developing strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear).

On March 11, 2020, the Government of Canada announced more than $1 billion for a whole-of-government COVID-19 Response Fund which included $100 million to support federal public health measures such as enhanced surveillance, increased testing at the Public Health Authority of Canada's (PHAC) National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) and ongoing support for preparedness in First Nations and Inuit communities.

On March 20, Canada launched its plan to ‘Mobilize Industry’ to fight COVID-19. https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/03/20/prime-minister-announces-canadas-plan-mobilize-industry-fight-covid. The plan introduced new measures directly supporting businesses to build domestic capacity, find innovative solutions, and speed procurement of essential supplies. It refocuses Canada’s existing industrial and innovation programs (i.e. Strategic Innovation Fund, Innovation Superclusters and Innovative Solutions Canada) by adding to their mandate a requirement that they prioritize the fight against COVID-19. It also directed support to key Canadian companies that are working on large-scale, late-stage R&D projects aiming, in the immediate term, at producing countermeasures to COVID-19. The National Research Council’s Industrial Research Assistance Program also launched a COVID-19 ‘challenge’ program to address a range of medium-term governmental needs, the most promising of which will be selected for procurement, working with Innovative Solutions Canada. https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/nrc-covid-19-programs

On March 23, 2020, $275 million was announced as part of the $1 billion investment (from March 11) to support research and large-scale efforts towards countermeasures to combat COVID-19. The funding is facilitating partnerships among various Canadian stakeholders including other government departments, industry and academia to respond to COVID-19 and build Canadian capacity to produce a domestic supply of potential vaccines and treatments. https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/03/23/canadas-plan-mobilize-science-fight-covid-19. Funding will be used to advance projects already underway by university researchers and others, including: prioritizing projects under the new Strategic Innovation Fund COVID-19 stream ($192M) for companies including: AbCellera in Vancouver and Medicago in Quebec City. The Government also committed to invest $23M in the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization - International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) ($11M from CFI, $12M from WD) to strengthen research expertise, help develop a vaccine, and expand clinical trials and bio-manufacturing capacity in the facility. The National Research Council will receive $15M to upgrade its Human Health Therapeutics facility in Montreal to develop, test and scale up promising vaccine candidates.  The Government will also support BlueDot, a Toronto-based technology firm, and use its disease analytics platform to support modelling and monitoring of the spread of COVID-19, and to inform government decision-making as the situation evolves.

On March 31, 2020, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council announced it is providing up to $15 million, as part of its Alliance COVID-19 Grants Initiative, to support academic researchers to contribute their expertise and their research results to address challenges and questions raised by the public and not-for-profit sectors, as well as industry in the context of the pandemic. https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Innovate-Innover/COVID-19/index_eng.asp

In late March, Canada became a participant in ""SOLIDARITY”, the WHO-led international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19. By enrolling patients in multiple countries, the SOLIDARITY trial aims to rapidly discover whether any of the drugs slow disease progression or improve survival. WHO has secured access to all treatments so as to obviate the supply issues that may be associated with other trials. The Canadian arm of the global trial, dubbed CATCO (Canadian Treatments for COVID-19), is being funded by the CIHR, which provided nearly $1 million. https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-clinical-trials/list-authorized-trials.html https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments

On April 23, 2020 the Government of Canada announced further investments of $1.1B in new medical countermeasures to better understand COVID-19, and develop the infrastructure needed to fight the virus here in Canada. This includes:
o The establishment of the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force that will establish priorities and oversee the coordination of a series of country-wide blood test surveys that will tell us how widely the virus has spread in Canada and provide reliable estimates of potential immunity and vulnerabilities in Canadian populations.
o $40 million for the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network (CanCOGeN), led by Genome Canada, to coordinate a COVID-19 viral and host genome sequencing effort across Canada. This research will help track the virus, its different strains, and how it makes people sick in different ways, providing valuable information to public health authorities and decision-makers as they put in place measures to control the pandemic. The results of this work will be available to researchers globally to support additional research, including Canadian vaccine development efforts.
o $23 million for the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) to accelerate development of a vaccine against COVID-19. This funding will support pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, essential steps to ensuring that vaccines are effective and safe for human use. 
o $29 million for the National Research Council of Canada to begin the second phase of critical upgrades to its Human Health Therapeutics facility in Montréal. Building on ongoing work to ready the facility for the production of vaccines for clinical trials, this funding will support operations to maintain the facility, as well as provide infrastructure to prepare vials for individual doses as soon as a vaccine becomes available.
o $600 million, through the Strategic Innovation Fund, over two years to support COVID-19 vaccine and therapy clinical trials led by the private sector, and Canadian biomanufacturing opportunities.
o $10 million for a Canadian data monitoring initiative so we can coordinate and share pandemic-related data across the country to enhance Canada’s response to COVID-19.
o $10.3 million over two years, and $5 million ongoing, to support the Canadian Immunization Research Network in conducting vaccine-related research and clinical trials, and to enhance Canada’s capacity to monitor vaccine safety and effectiveness.
o $114.9 million through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research for research projects that will accelerate the development, testing, and implementation of medical and social countermeasures to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19, as well as its social and health impacts.
o Separately, the Government of Canada is providing over $675,000 through the Stem Cell Network to support two new research projects and one clinical trial. The clinical trial will evaluate the safety of a potential cell therapy to reduce the impacts and severity of acute respiratory distress associated with COVID-19, and the two projects will generate critical information about how cells in the airway and brain are affected by the virus.

 a $1.5M envelope that provides short-term and timely support for small-scale, stakeholder-driven partnerships through Partnership Engage Grants (PEG). This Special Initiative will allow researchers and their partners the possibility to address urgent and specific needs, as well as challenges or opportunities through collaborations. It will also provide an opportunity to foster knowledge exchange between researchers and different sectors of society. Grants are valued at a maximum amount of $25K per project for duration of one year.
",Please refer to collaborations outlined in answers to the question on coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level. ,"The Government of Canada (GoC), through the Canadian Institutes of Health (CIHR) and partners, mobilized to launch a COVID-19 rapid response call for proposals intended to solicit investigator-led research focused on both medical and social/policy countermeasures. CIHR is organizing a series of knowledge mobilization events to maximize the impact of these investments, support coordination, and bring the best available evidence forward to support decision-making and action. This includes a small number of targeted virtual investigator meetings to foster meaningful engagement between federally-funded researchers and relevant federal departments and agencies actively engaged in the response to COVID-19.

Within the CIHR funded projects, AI is being used to scan through thousands of approved drugs for the identification of candidates to explore further their utility and safety for treating COVID-19. To improve the provision of public health care, a CIHR funded project is developing a tool to provide precision public health. Other funded projects will be developing AI-driven tools to conduct surveillance coupled with real-time human mobility data and use social media/news data to understand how misinformation and information is provided to Canadians.

The National Collaborating Centres for Public Health synthesize, translate and share knowledge, making it useful and accessible to policy-makers, program managers and practitioners. They identify knowledge gaps, stimulate research in priority areas, and link public health researchers with practitioners to build strong practice-based networks across Canada.  https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/public-health-practice/national-collaborating-centres-public-health.html. The National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools hosts a repository of COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Reviews:  https://www.nccmt.ca/knowledge-repositories/covid-19-evidence-reviews

Within the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), AI methodologies are being used for the extraction of surveillance data from the web and posted in the Federal Dashboard. Social media is being analysed using machine learning to detect clusters of COVID-19 outbreaks; while the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) continues to use natural language processing to monitor news information to detect emerging risks. This methodology is also starting to be explored for conducting literature reviews, to assist with the tagging of pertinent articles
","Canada supports the statement of the ‘Global Preparedness Monitoring Board on COVID-19’ that called on countries, institutions, communities and partners to ensure that all relevant information about the outbreak is shared openly and rapidly, and that information should be made available for both human and machine-readable format to allow for full text and data-mining using AI with rights accorded for research re-use and secondary analysis. Open research was a requirement for funding under Canada’s Rapid Research Funding Opportunity on COVID-19.

In the short term, Canada is committed to fast-track and mobilize Canadian researchers and life sciences companies and support large-scale efforts towards medical countermeasures to combat COVID-19, including potential vaccines and treatments.

In the medium and longer-term, Canada aims to better understand and respond to emerging pathogens, while ensuring scientific excellence and leveraging novel technologies.

With the aim of providing true information and undermining false beliefs around COVID-19, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation has undertaken an intersectoral strategy of Public Communication of Science and Public Outreach. This strategy includes the following specific components:

i) First, the production of infographics and digital videographies from the technical inputs provided by high-level experts, who participate in an ongoing series of dialogues organized by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia to discuss matters related to COVID-19. This information is the result of an analysis of data collected by the different actors who are leading the fight against COVID-19 in Colombia, presented in a way the public would find pedagogical and easy to understand.  This material is released in collaboration with various actors from the National STI System and other government entities through websites, social networks and other digital media, in order to empower the audiences who access and share this content.

ii) Second, the creation of live, online, participatory dialogues with experts. These spaces allow experts to address some of the most common misunderstandings about the virus and the crisis it has caused, using examples and technical explanations. For this exercise, users can submit questions through social networks, fostering a participatory and dynamic dialogue where citizens are represented. These dialogues are broadcast regularly throughout the period of quarantine declared by the national government.

iii) Finally, a special edition will be produced entitled ""The Coronavirus from different views of the Sciences"" with about 10 different texts and related audiovisual material. This will be an opportunity to make an in-depth reading of the current situation through the viewpoints of different areas of knowledge in relation to COVID-19. This material will be released in approximately 3 weeks, in collaboration with actors of the National STI System and other government entities including the Ministry of Health and shared through their digital media, in order to widen its public reach.
","● Mapping molecular biology laboratories in Colombian Universities:

The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation is leading the initiative for mapping molecular biology laboratories in Colombian universities through a survey designed by the academic sector. This instrument was a task requested by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, the Ministry of National Education and the National Institute of Health of Colombia, with the objective of mapping the capacities of the laboratories in the universities of Colombia to support the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 from the identification of the genetic markers for SARS-CoV-2.

This information will be an essential input to know which laboratories have BCL-2 biosafety standards and have documented and verified procedures for quality assurance, sample traceability and validity of results. Furthermore, the results of the survey will detect if these laboratories have methodological control and endorsement of the tests and service qualification. It is important to clarify that the survey is still in the process of completion by the universities and other entities, therefore the results are not conclusive yet.

● Program: Strengthening and provision of equipment, infrastructure and medical supplies for early detection and care of patients affected by Coronavirus in Colombia ""Covid-19 Colombia""

This project aims to increase the conditions of care for laboratories in frontier areas and vulnerable territories in the departments of Amazonas, Cauca, Chocó, Guajira, Magdalena, Nariño, San Andrés and Vichada in the context of the campaign against COVID-19. The total budget for the project is 19,5 million dollars, with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia contributing 6,5 million dollars and seeking to leverage 13 million dollars. This project arises from the profound imbalance existing between regions in Colombia, where social gaps highlight the need to improve public health equipment and capacities in the border areas and other areas with high levels of vulnerability.

This objective will be achieved by strengthening the provision of equipment, infrastructure and medical supplies to laboratories and research centers for the early detection and care of patients possibly affected by COVID-19. The following 3 results are expected:

i) Provision of equipment for laboratories and medical staff for the testing of COVID-19.
ii) To design a strategy for the Social Appropriation and Dissemination of Knowledge about COVID-19.
iii) Support for research centers, universities and companies in R&D and innovation projects against COVID-19.

","Acknowledging the current global scenario caused by the Covid-19 and the challenges that it imposes, the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, Mrs. Mabel Torres and her team have proposed two dialogues with experts in the framework of the COVID-19 crisis in Colombia. The goal of these dialogues is to create environments where the actors of the national STI system can meet and actively discuss the issues.

● First Dialogue of Experts

The First Experts' Dialogue took place on March 17, 2020, proposed by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, Mrs. Mabel Torres. Considering that Colombia is well aware of the vulnerability and susceptibility of its population concerning COVID-19 and its need to generate strong, robust and decisive action as a country against the virus's effects, the dialogue seeks to be a space for articulation and active discussion among the actors of the national STI system.

The general purpose of the dialogue was to provide strategic and disruptive elements that will help state institutions strengthen the actions being carried out by the National Health Institute of Colombia, based on the articulation of several actors of the national STI system against COVID-19. The main actors in the first dialogue were the academic sector, public and private institutes (among them the National Health Institute and the Institute for Health Technology Assessment), two delegates from the Indigenous Intercultural Health System, the Academy of Medicine, three experts on artificial intelligence, and the Minister of STI and her team.

This Dialogue was conceived as an environment for extended, reflexive, constructive, opportune and pro-positive conversation among the actors of the national STI system, therefore some guiding questions were formulated taking into account the current scenario of the COVID-19 from a perspective of the tasks, challenges and responsibilities that we have as a country. The guiding questions were:
i) What should be the priority actions for the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation in the framework of COVID-19, aiming at promoting the social appropriation of knowledge in the face of the current Coronavirus pandemic, in order to contribute to its mitigation?
ii) How can the academy and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation support the efforts of the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Health to address the COVID-19 pandemic at the national and regional level?
iii) How does the current juncture allow us to be better equipped in terms of policies, plans and programs as a country, to face contingencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic?
iv) How does the current contingency contribute to the formulation of public STI policy and to strengthening the national STI system?

● Second Dialogue of Experts

The Second Experts' Dialogue was held on March 26, 2020, proposed by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, Mrs. Mabel Torres. The objective was to identify from the differential and territorial approach, and taking into account national and international learning: (i) first, the management of the COVID-19 pandemic; and (ii) second, the challenges for research agendas, useful for the production of evidence, as well as for decision making and public policy formulation.

The main actors in the second dialogue were: 6 experts from the academic sector, including doctors, with specializations in Health Services Management, Public Health, Epidemiology, Molecular Biology and Virology. Two international guests attended, Dr. Oscar Franco, Epidemiologist and Director Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) in Bern, Switzerland, and Edna Martinez, Doctorate in Sociology from the Free University of Berlin. At a national level, guests from the National Planning Department and the Director of Emergencies and Disasters Ministry of Health and Social Protection also attended.

There was an introductory context on socio-cultural and political phenomena that may influence the response to the COVID-19, during the containment and mitigation phase. Then, each panelists presented from their perspective the current and future challenges in the field of research in aspects of public health, health service provision, social protection interventions, or in the field of comprehensive social intervention, following their expertise (socio-cultural dynamics, world views, practices and knowledge of indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, migrant population). Likewise, an overview of the international experience allowed for the identification of lessons learned in Europe.

Subsequently, an exchange of ideas and proposals was promoted with the attendees, in order to establish the challenges and responsibilities that correspond to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, as well as those of other sectors or responses that require a sectoral response.

Finally, an analysis of the research challenges or technological or innovation alternatives potentially useful for the contingency was carried out. The guiding questions were:
i) Taking into account territorial differences and social determinants, how should the COVID-19 Pandemic be dealt with?
ii) How do socio-cultural and political dynamics or ethnic characteristics affect the approach to the pandemic?
iii) How can the problems of accessibility and opportunity to provide services and the territorial capacities be overcome with the support of Science, Technology and Innovation?
iv) What alternatives are foreseen for regions with public order problems, migrant population, floating population, for a comprehensive approach to the pandemic?
v) What are the lessons learned and significant experiences that would stand out abroad during the first months? Which should not be repeated?
vi) What would you incorporate as a priority for research or innovation? 
",,"● MinCienciatón

One of the main initiatives taken by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia (with the support of the Colombian Ministry of Health) is the opening of the call MinCienciatón, which is an initiative to confront COVID-19 through the use of the STI.

See https://minciencias.gov.co/convocatorias/invitacion-para-presentacion-propuestas/invitacion-presentar-proyectos-que-contribuyan.

Disruptive proposals are expected that will help, for example, the interpretation of data for decision making, and technology that will facilitate the protection of healthcare personnel and patient care in mitigating symptoms. These proposals will be monitored and evaluated by panels of experts who will determine the best ideas. It is important to note that each proposal will have a funding of between 500 million COP and 2 billion COP. With this initiative, it is expected to mobilize more than 500 research groups throughout the country.

The following three modalities are contemplated for the financing of the projects:
i) Public health initiatives related to epidemiological intelligence that will make it possible to plan and act effectively in the event of epidemiological contingencies.
ii) Pre-commercial validation: evaluation of technology prototypes in relevant environments. Projects focused on the pre-commercial validation of new technologies.
iii) Commercial validation: scaling up of technologies for their validation in real operating conditions. Projects focused on the commercial validation of new technologies.

Additionally, the following lines have been established:
i) Public health related to intervention against epidemiological risks associated with COVID-19.
ii) Rapid diagnostic systems for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
iii) Strategies for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and treating COVID-19.
iv) Medical equipment and devices for the management of patients with COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections, ensuring the safety of health professionals.
v) Systems for monitoring real-time data on illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other agents that cause acute respiratory infections, to facilitate decision-making

Lastly, one of the main characteristics of this call is that it is an ad hoc initiative, with rapid processes for the reception and selection of proposals (around 14 days are projected between the time the call is opened and the announcement of the results), which is a novelty for the traditional processes of the calls.

Another iniciative taken by the MIT related to COVID-19 is described under the Q4A. 
","The Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as “MIT”) launched new platform “CONNECTING THE CZECH REPUBLIC (SPOJUJEME ČESKO): Innovation and modern technology help manage the coronavirus pandemic“. It was prepared jointly with CzechInvest agency, which both cooperate with the Ministriy of Health, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Transport, Office of the Government of the Czech Republic, CzechTrade Agency, Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic, universities and private sector (https://www.mpo.cz/en/guidepost/for-the-media/press-releases/connecting-the-czech-republic-spojujeme-cesko-innovation-and-modern-technology-help-manage-the-coronavirus-pandemic--253751/).

The Council for Research, Development and Innovation (hereinafter referred to as “CRDI”) - CRDI´s main role is governance and coordination of RDI on the Czech national level, including preparation of the framework of public budget spending for RDI activities. The CRDI members are actors and experts from different RDI areas and the CRDI team is composed of representatives of academia, industries and other RDI stakeholders (https://www.vyzkum.cz/Default.aspx?lang=en).
","The Czech Republic is contributing to discussions and cooperates within the European Union as well as with other international organisations worldwide in various directions of the utmost important subjects in this area. 

At the European level, in the past few weeks an umbrella document originated on the platform of EU Member States and the European Commission - the so-called Action Plan ""ERAvsCorona"". It provides a wide range of measures constituting a response to the current pandemic. One of the key instruments of implementation of the Action Plan is already the 8th EU Framework Program for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 (2014-2020), in which the first specifically targeted call has led to funding of a total of 18 European research projects focused on diagnostics, vaccines and drugs development against Covid-19 in the total amount reaching nearly 50 million EUR (https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/health-research-and-innovation/coronavirus-research-and-innovation_en). 

The Technology Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic is the national information centre for European RDI, and has created a website on information about European RDI opportunities in relation to Covid-19 (https://www.tc.cz/en).
 
The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (hereinafrer referred to as „ESFRI“) is putting all its effort in helping to coordinate actions and investments among research infrastructures at the European and national levels for the development of diagnostic tools, treatments and vaccines, as well as the analysis of the economic and social impacts of the implemented confinement measures. ESFRI is helping the scientific community by gathering information about dedicated services offered by research infrastructures and communicating all relevant actions as broadly as possible (https://www.esfri.eu/covid-19). 

Participation of the Czech Republic on the international global level takes place within organizations such as WHO (http://www.euro.who.int/en/home) or UNESCO
(https://reliefweb.int/report/world/unesco-mobilizes-122-countries-promote-open-science-and-reinforced-cooperation-face). 
",,"The Czech Government adopted the COVID program (interest-free funding for entrepreneurs affected by coronavirus infection). It was prepared by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) and the Czech-Moravian Guarantee and Development Bank (CMZRB). It aims to facilitate access to operational funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, whose economic activities are limited due to the occurrence of coronavirus infection and related preventive measures (https://www.cmzrb.cz/en/).

Among the proposed instruments are:
• The COVID Loan program provides support for SMEs in the form of soft loans in the amount of CZK 500 000 (approx. 20 000 EUR) up to CZK 15 million (approx. 600 000 EUR) with zero interest rate. Loans are granted up to 90 % of eligible expenditure with a maturity of 2 years, including the possibility of deferred repayment for up to 12 months. The loan may be used, for example, for the acquisition of small tangible or intangible assets, the acquisition and financing of inventories or for other operating expenses and expenditures. There are no fees associated with the processing and granting of the loan or its possible early repayment. Applicants for the COVID Loan will benefit from this interest-free financing, if their contractual performance has been delayed, suspended or cancelled due to measures taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection (https://www.cmzrb.cz/podnikatele/uvery/uver-covid/). 

• The guarantee program COVID II was the next one in a series of upcoming supports announced by the CMZRB (https://www.cmzrb.cz/podnikatele/uvery/uver-covid/).

• The CMZRB in cooperation with the MIT, Capitol of Prague and commercial banks prepared further guarantee schemes such as COVID Prague and/or COVID III. The COVID Prague Program was already launched. The COVID III Program will be announced soon. 

","At national level, all described activities in responses to previous questions support the STI system and thus contribute to the economy recovery and development. To briefly summarize, among such activities are those of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechInvest, Czech-Moravian Guarantee and Development Bank and/or Technology Agency of the Czech Republic. ",
Denmark,2020-03-28 17:04:48.000,"Several agencies under the Danish Ministry of Health employ health professionals and scientific personal (e.g. the medicines agency and the Statens Serum Institut (SSI)). These agencies inform the minister of health, just like they are available for other ministries and agencies. As an example, the SSI participate at every press briefing held by the Danish authorities concerning Covid-19. ","Denmark is a member of several international forums, where action on Covid-19 is coordinated. ","The site Videnskab.dk, which is publicly funded, communicates on science in general, including on Covid-19. Denmark has also launched the site coronasmitte.dk, where all information from Danish public authorities can be found. ","The Danish government has funded research projects, which can help to create new knowledge and new solutions in the fight against Covid-19. In total DKK 50 million has been granted in a fast track model, where the deans of the four faculties of health sciences, the pro-rector of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the academic director of the Statens Serum Institute (SSI) have been asked to submit proposals for Covid-19 related research projects from the researchers at their own institutions.
The whole process took about one week, from call for proposals, to relevant research projects being identified, and funding granted.

Estonia,2020-03-30 09:18:16.000,"On 20 March 2020 the Government Committee tasked with resolving the issues related to events caused by the spread of the COVID-19-causing coronavirus and issues of public health and the economy assembled a scientific advisory board (the Science Council) and confirmed its members. The task of the advisory board is to provide expert information to the Government Committee on the emergency situation. The work of the advisory board is organised by the Government Office and the Ministry of Social Affairs.

Entrepreneurial analytics are prepared and statistical advice is shared in co-operation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Ministry of Financial Affairs, Government Office, Estonian Tax Board, KredEx, Enterprise Estonia, and Statistics Estonia.","The head of the Government Committee on the emergency situation, the Prime Minister, meets regularly with his counterparts across Europe. Also, other Ministers have regular contact with their counterparts to discuss best practices and possible solutions.","The whole government amplifies the messages of the Science Council formed to address the crisis, and bases all decisions on research-based recommendations. There are parallel information campaigns online and in other forms of media to target different groups in society.

Scientists are actively commenting and giving interviews for national media. There are civic society initiatives in social media promoting responsible use of information. ","The Estonian Research Council (ETAg) is coordinating collection of information about the need for new research topics and the capabilities of research performing organizations to do the needed research. 

The quickest way to react is to channel researchers' immediate responses within the framework of existing measures. The planned interventions are divided into short-term fast-line research that provide an up-to-date understanding of the spread of the virus, as well as to help identify the immediate socio-economic effects. This type of research is expected to bring results within a few months. Longer-term research grants are currently being developed – these are more forward looking and will require a longer-term effort.  

Short-term needs are addressed in the framework of the RITA program (see https://www.etag.ee/en/funding/programmes/rita/) through which ETAg has launched an additional call for projects addressing COVID-19. At least two projects (worth approximately 50 000 euros each) will be co-financed (ministries will contribute with 40% of co-financing). Topics will be selected and approved by the scientific advisers of different ministries. The call is open to all R&D institutions. The dedication of more additional funding from structural funds is currently under negotiations with the Ministry of Education and Research.
  
Some of the research groups are working with their international counterparts within existing cooperation networks. 


","An analytics working group, consisting of analysts from the Ministries of Financial Affairs and Economic Affairs, as well as Bank of Estonia, is modelling the outbreak for the Government, and creating economic scenarios and relevant response measures.

The Estonian Research Council has a co-operation platform including the top research managers of research performing organizations. The first meeting for sharing information and discussing possible needed actions and solutions is scheduled for early April. 

The stakeholders are encouraged to submit Covid-19 related applications to the ongoing open call of the funding program ’Nutikas’. The ERDF-funded program supports companies in commissioning necessary applied research or product development projects from universities or research institutions. The aim is to engage private sector to collaborate with research institutions. The additional budget is yet to be fixed.
About the program, see: https://www.etag.ee/en/funding/programmes/nutikas-applied-research-in-smart-specialisation-growth-areas/.","Estonia is participating in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) - such international infrastructures have responded to the pandemic by developing technical solutions to share and coordinate data (genomic, clinical, epidemiological data). Estonian researchers are closely involved in these activities through linked projects.","The Government of Estonia decided to close all educational institutions, except kindergartens, and has applied only digital learning solutions since 16 March. Further information can be found here (incl. FAQ): https://www.hm.ee/en/spread-covid-19-recommendations-educational-institutions. Moreover, Estonian education technology companies have offered their solutions free of charge for the international community to tackle the crisis (see: https://www.hm.ee/en/news/estonia-offers-its-digital-education-solutions-free-support-other-countries).

Estonia put together an online hackathon HackTheCrisis (by Acclererate Estonia) to offer solutions on how to use technology for the crisis response and to deal with the post-crisis era. The action was supported by the Ministry of Economics and Communication. Now HackTheCrisis events run by local communities all over the world are popping up to help solve issues for their communities.

Other initiatives include:
• Salto Growth Camp EMERGE initiative for start-ups;
• Share Force One platform for bringing together jobs and jobless in the situation of rapid entrepreneurial changes;
• Estonian Statistics Board in cooperation with Positium, a private company preparing mobile positioning solutions, are working out a visual showing information about people’s mobility during the epidemic. The solution is designed to show both everyday short range mobility, to visualize for instance the mobility of quarantined persons, and long range mobility, to visualize, for instance, where participants have moved from an event where it is known that infected people have been.
• Non-personalized information about the infected by counties, age and sex is being provided on the Estonian Open Data Platform.

","Less mobility and travelling bring with them more remote studying, working and video conferencing via specialised devices and software; more commercial and government services are moving online, and more digitalisation and automated production is occurring in industry. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is continuously observing, encouraging, coordinating and implementing these developments in the Estonian government and enterprises.","Government support in the form of financial instruments (guarantees and warranties) for enterprises has been declared and is being implemented, as well as support for the workforce (e.g. through withholding taxes and providing direct wage support) – it is expected to support start-up businesses, which are both weakly capitalised and have wages as a relatively high share of costs.

Stimulus packages will be specifically designed to support not only existing enterprises and economic structures, but also to bring along small behavioural changes in entrepreneurial activity towards investments in knowledge-based capital, and future re-structuration and growth.",
European Union,2020-06-12 14:32:15.000,"We will answer this as “informing EU policy and decision-making”:
New advisory structures
 Advisory panel on COVID-19: group of epidemiologists and virologists to provide recommendations to the Commission on response measures, including policy measures for addressing and mitigating medium and long-term consequences of COVID-19, chaired by the Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and co-chaired by Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety. Established on 16.03.2020 by EC Decision C(2020)1799 T
The panel will provide advice to the Commission on the following:
Formulation of response measures to be addressed to all Member States
• Identification and mitigation of significant gaps and inconsistencies in measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including in clinical management and treatment
• Prioritisation of health care, civil protection and other resources as well as support measures to be organised or coordinated at EU level
• Subsequently, recommendation of policy measures for addressing and mitigating long-term consequences of COVID-19.

 Special Advisor to President Von der Leyen: Peter Piot was appointed to advise the Commission in supporting and steering research and innovation (R&I) in the global fight against COVID-19; he will also advise the Commission on increasing European preparedness in case of future epidemics making best use of research and innovation. This will imply advice on the acceleration of the development, manufacture and deployment of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines; also member of the above mentioned advisory panel.

 COVID-19 Ad Hoc group: set up by EC together with MS in the framework of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan to strengthen the operational coordination of R&I funding against COVID-19 covering the whole pipeline (from pre-clinical research to products being available to citizens) for vaccines, treatments and testing; work is carried out in four subgroups: (1) Clinical trials, (2) Manufacturing, (3) Testing, and (4) Financing.

 Foresight: study on the scientific, technological and societal conditions for the end of the COVID 19 crisis; May-July 2020.

 JRC Coronavirus Task Force: Set up to coordinate and connect the different scientific activities and contributions of the JRC to the EC’s COVID-19 response

Already existing advisory structures 
 The European Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control (ECDC): providing risk assessments, guidance, and advice on public health response activities to EU Member States and the EU Commission; it is also represented in the above-mentioned advisory panel on COVID-19.
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA): providing advice to patients and healthcare professionals on the safe use of medicines during the pandemic, and providing scientific and regulatory advice to developers and companies on COVID-19.
 EC’s Group of Chief Scientific Advisors: a group of highly qualified independent experts with the mandate to provide independent scientific advice and at the request of the College to inform its decision-making and thus contribute to the quality of EU legislation. 
 European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE): An independent, multi-disciplinary body, which advises on all aspects of Commission policies where ethical, societal and fundamental rights issues intersect with the development of science and new technologies. The EGE agreed to cooperate with the GCSA and Prof. Piot in the provision of science advice on COVID-19 (see above).
 European Commission Expert Group “Economic and Societal Impact of Research and Innovation” (ESIR): a group of independent experts delivering analysis, insight and recommendations for the further elaboration of policies that can enhance the contribution of R&I to the overall EU policy agenda. The ESIR group just published its first Policy Brief ‘Protect, prepare and transform Europe’ that fed into the Commission’s post-COVID-19 strategy (the recovery package).
 The whole JRC has been mobilised to provide evidence that might support the tasks of Crisis Management while to start thinking in the aftermath of the crisis, including the elaboration of models to determine which are the most effective exit scenarios and their consequences. This includes, among other input, guidelines and control materials for testing and better characterization of the pandemics; epidemiological modelling; the detailed analysis on economic impact in different sectors (agriculture, energy supply, transport, …); the analysis of social aspects along with the environmental perspective; scientific input to supporting the African response to COVID-19; and more.  
 The JRC’s Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre: The Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre (DRMKC) provides a networked approach to the science-policy interface in DRM, across the Commission, EU Member States and the DRM community within and beyond the EU. In the COVID-19 context, the DRMKC serves as one important network and platform to produce, assemble, store and share external and internal scientific research in response to the pandemic. Lessons learned report on COVID-19 crisis management will be part of the second “Science for Disaster Risk Management” flagship report.   

","The European Commission is coordinating a common European response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Coordination efforts are wide-ranging and take place at the Commission, broader EU, Member State and international levels. The EC is taking resolute action to reinforce our public health sectors and mitigate the socio-economic impact in the European Union. There are active discussions between DG R&I and the R&I DGs of the national administrations to discuss the coordination of R&I actions on COVID19.

The crisis coordination mechanism of the Commission has been activated and the Crisis Coordination Committee meets regularly to synergise the action of all the relevant departments and services of the Commission and of the EU agencies. It is chaired by Commissioner Janez Lenarčič in his role of European Emergency Response Coordinator. The Commission has also established a coordinating response team at political level composed of the commissioners responsible for the most affected policies.

External coordination on the R&I response is ensured mainly through the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R). This is a network of preparedness research funders; the Commission funds its secretariat and is one of the vice chairs. Regular teleconferences are held between chairs and vice chairs of GloPID-R, and also with the World Health Organisation (WHO). The network is keen to create synergies between the different research efforts and avoid duplication.
Furthermore, bilateral talks are being held with those Member States that have indicated that they intend to provide support for Corona virus-related research in order to better understand the destinations being considered for their funding efforts.

Additionally, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), which is an initiative that focuses on vaccine development (the Commission is a financial contributor), is ‘fast forwarding’ a programme of vaccine development against COVID-19, aiming to initiate clinical trials of vaccine candidates and to support the development of hundreds of millions of doses.

The EU is assuming responsibility towards the African continent with insufficient health systems to cope – through the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP).

The President of the European Commission has indicated after G20 that the EU stands ready to organise a pledging conference with focus on vaccine development.

The EU has a leading position on open science and is leading the way internationally by connecting initiatives launched by US (OSTP) and UNESCO Plea.","The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an ‘infodemic’ – a substantial increase of misinformation and targeted disinformation campaigns- that poses a twofold threat to the EU. Firstly, ‘infodemic’ has been proven to adversely impact public health by the dissemination of false and harmful information. Secondly, an advancement of geopolitical or commercial interests by malign actors.
The Commission is active in the area of citizen outreach and communication: within the EC page for the Coronavirus response (https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en), the Commission has launched a page to inform about all the EU research projects and initiatives to tackle the spread of COVID-19 and preparedness for other outbreaks: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/health-research-and-innovation/coronavirus-research_en 

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is closely monitoring this outbreak, providing risk assessments, public health guidance, and advice on response activities to EU Member States and the EU Commission.

On ‘fake news’, the European Commission is helping fight disinformation through close cooperation with online platforms. The EC is encouraging them to promote authoritative sources, demote content that is fact-checked as false or misleading, and take down illegal content or content that could cause physical harm.
In 2018, the Commission adopted a Communication on tackling online disinformation, together with a code of good practice for digital platforms and an action plan, aiming to protect the democratic systems of the EU MS. In this context, the European External Action Service runs the EUvsDisinfo website https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ that detects narratives about the supposed superiority of authoritarian regimes in addressing COVID-19, as opposed to the perceived weaknesses of democracies. In addition, Europol provides advice on how to fight COVID-19 fake news, and a number of MS set up national task forces to monitor and counter country-specific false information. DG COMM set up a ‘Fighting disinformation’ corner under the Commission’s Coronavirus response website. DG R&I has flagged multiple instances of harmful narratives, and developed and disseminated resources helpful in countering misinformation. DG R&I also provided content for a new webpage listing EU-funded R&I projects working against disinformation. A Communication Tackling COVID-19 disinformation - Getting the facts right on disinformation focussing on the COVID-19 specific issues on which DG R&I already provided input was adopted on 10 June. 
The European Commission has also raised attention to the rise of online scams and unfair practices: on 23 March 2020, Commissioner For Justice and Consumers Didier Reynders wrote to a number of platforms, social media, search engines and market places to require their cooperation in taking down scams from their platforms, following the common position endorsed by the CPC network. On 20 March 2020, the consumer protection (CPC) authorities of the Member States, with the support of the Commission, issued CPC Common Position COVID-19 on the most reported scams and unfair practices in this context. The objective is to ask and help online platform operators to better identify such illegal practices, take them down and prevent similar ones to reappear. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-tackling-covid-19-disinformation-getting-facts-right_en.pdf 
","The Commission is providing direct support for research and innovation.
Research and innovation (R&I) plays a key role in the COVID-19 outbreak and R&I related actions are an essential part of the coordinated EU response. These actions focus on: 
1. Support new R&I;
2. Speeding up research by optimising framework conditions; 
3. Translating research findings into public health policy;
4. Internal and external coordination; 
5. Analysis of social and economic impacts
6. Outreach and communication.

2. SPEEDING UP RESEARCH AND INNOVATION – OPTIMISING ENABLING FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS
Research Infrastructures
• Horizon 2020 grants access to essential Research Infrastructure (RI) services are repurposing their calls and considering stepped-up efforts to focus on COVID-19. Beyond the European Virus Archive and TRANSVAC for vaccine research, this includes other EU supported pan-European RIs: SoBigData-Plus (big data analytics); ERINHA (high-risk pathogen safety labs); ELIXIR (coordinating the storage of and access to biological data); ECRIN (clinical trials). CALIPSO-PLUS and CERIC-ERIC have set up a dedicated Fast Track Access to a selected number of analytical facilities for research related to the COVID-19. 
Research data sharing
• DG R&I in close collaboration with DG SANTE, DG CONNECT and EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), together with EU Member States and research partners such as ELIXIR, has launched (20 April) the European COVID-19 research data platform. This joint effort is a priority pilot to realise the goals of European Open Science Cloud and is part of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan. This will allow the scientific community to share, analyse, and process data rapidly, openly and effectively across the Member States and the globe. See message by EC President Ursula von der Leyen on the launch of the EU COVID19 Data Platform and press release.

• To complement the platform deployment, the EC is urging all H2020 projects working on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 to provide immediate open access to their related publications, data and any other output. To support them, a guidance document has been developed that includes specific guidelinees regarding FAIR principles, Open Access to publications and data, etc.

• The Research Data Alliance Working Group on COVID-19 has gathered more than 300 domain and data experts from all over the world to produce a set of guidelines and recommendations for data sharing in public health emergencies to support scientific research and policy making. It covers data from 5 sub-groups focusing on essential thematic areas: Clinical, Community Participation, Epidemiology, Omics, and Social Sciences. The 5th (pre final) release of the COVID-19 Recommendations and Guidelines was published on 28 May and it is open for comments until 8 June. Then, after revision and endorsement by the RDA governance bodies, the final version will be published on 30 June.

• OpenAIRE, in collaboration with the EC, will provide services to help in the sharing, discovery, navigation and collaboration of the global research community. In particular, a beta version of the service (operational) has now been released to serve as a single entry point for research results (publications, data, and software) for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. This service is linked to the other data sharing initiatives

• The European Open Science Cloud Secretariat has introduced a fast-track procedure to apply for funding, specifically dedicated to activities related to COVID-19 in the area of Open Science and research data sharing. The deadline for applications is on 12 June.

Platform to share Information
• DG SANTE’s Health Policy Platform - In order to facilitate easy communication between researchers on initial and unconfirmed observations, a moderated space called “researchers chat” (with restricted access) was set up on DG SANTE’s Health Policy Platform. This allows low-threshold exchange between researchers from different projects, promoting also interdisciplinary connections. 

• The European Commission launched (14 May) the new European Research Area (ERA) corona platform. The ERA corona platform is a one-stop shop for information for current and prospective beneficiaries of the R&I Programmes The platform provides useful information, dedicated support and real-time updates on funding opportunities for coronavirus related research and innovation. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is facing unprecedented challenges in the search for solutions against coronavirus. Good coordination and quick mobilisation of funds are essential to help our researchers and innovators meet those challenges. 

Pan-EU Hackathon
• The European Commission under the patronage of Cssr Mariya Gabriel, in close collaboration with EU member states, host an online Pan-EU Hackathon April 24 -26 (#EUvsVirus) to connect civil society, innovators, partners and buyers across Europe to develop innovative solutions to overcome coronavirus-related challenges.  The ‘Winning’ solutions in each challenge area were announced (April 30) here. Winners were invited to a Matchathon that took place 22 - 25 May on the new EIC COVID Platform was created to facilitate connections with end users, such as hospitals, and provide access to investors, foundations and other funding opportunities from across the EU. 

Seal of Excellence
• On 8 May, the European Commission granted the first batch of the EIC COVID-19 Response Seal of Excellence to 82 excellent proposals addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. On 4 June, after the final selection, the second batch of COVID-19 related seals was granted to 57 COVID related Seal proposals making a total of 139 COVID-19 seals with a total amount of support of EUR 384 million. The proposals were submitted under European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator Pilot (March 20 cut-off). The Seal certificate, co-signed now by Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, and by Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira, is addressed to excellent proposals from the EIC Accelerator call which have been evaluated worth of funding but for which Horizon Europe does not have enough resources in the call. 

Ethics
• One of the main obstacles to the speedy launch of clinical trials being the slow and complex approval by the appropriate committees, the Commission is asking projects to raise any issues they may encounter in this respect and encouraging Member States to look into these issues by priority. European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) Statement on European solidarity and the protection of fundamental rights in the COVID-19 pandemic (2 April).The EGE calls for a rallying of solidarity at the European and global level and underlines the core ethical considerations that must shape the pathway out of the pandemic.
Adequacy regulatory point of view
• Where relevant, projects are asked to engage with the European Medical Agency (EMA) in order to ensure from an early stage onwards the adequacy of the proposals from a regulatory point of view. 

3. TRANSLATING RESEARCH FINDINGS INTO PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY FOR PANDEMIC RESPONSE 

• Initial research findings may inform the public health response. The Horizon 2020 model grant agreement obliges the early dissemination of such findings. Another specific moderated space called “research to policy action” (with restricted access) has been set up on DG SANTE’s Health Policy Platform for the posting of such findings and for review of their relevance (and possible recommendations to the Health Security Committee) by the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control (ECDC)

4. COOPERATION AND COORDINATION

• The dynamic ERAvsCorona Action Plan - short-term coordinated R&I actions identifies the first 10 priority R&I work streams for coordinated action between the Commission and the Member States has received support at the informal video conference of ministers of research, 7 April. 

• On 29 May, in the informal High Level Video-Conference ,the R&I Ministers debated on the lessons learnt from the research and innovation response to the COVID-19 outbreak, on how R&I investments can be best used to boost future jobs and on the role of R&I in the recovery. Ministers reaffirmed the importance of R&I investments at European and national level, and anchoring science at the heart of policy formulation. The ERAvsCorona Action Plan was mentioned as example that it is possible to deliver concrete results in a short time.

• The European Union is currently joining forces with global partners to a pledging effort – the Coronavirus Global Response – an International Pledging Event, led by the EC started on 4 May 2020. It is a joint call for action to develop fast and equitable access to safe, quality, effective and affordable diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines against coronavirus. The Commission registered already EUR 9.8 billion, EUR 2.3 billion in pledges beyond the initial target  of EUR 7.5 million  that includes a pledge of EUR 1.4 billion by EC (EUR 1 billion is through reprioritisation of Horizon 2020). The pledging marathon steps up to the next phase and marks the beginning of a new campaign that will culminate in a final Global Pledging Summit on Saturday 27 June. Together with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen, the Commission will step up the mobilisation of funding to enable the world to overcome this pandemic and avoid another. Table that presents a complete overview of all funding pledged and already mobilised under Horizon 2020 to contribute to the Coronavirus Global Response pledging marathon.

• Several meetings to coordinate the efforts at International level took place, in particular at G20 level Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has participated at several high-level videoconference with chief scientific advisors, ministers and leaders of international partners on COVID-19.

• UNESCO hosted an online Ministerial meeting (30 March) with representatives of ministries in charge of science from all over the world to which Commissioner Gabriel participated. This meeting provided a platform for sharing experiences and lessons learnt on how science has informed evidence based on decision-making.

","Short-term impacts:
• Some impact on scientific  events (including e.g. health research related conferences), increased workload on health professionals (some impact on their research work) and potential slowdown in clinical trials activity.
• The mobility of human resources in science, technology and innovation is affected (including researchers, scientists, postdocs) but appears limited to some regions. The impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity is thus limited.
• Limited impact is also expected on global innovation networks process industries (incl. energy and resource intensive industries such as chemicals or steel) or materials research organisations.
• Low impact is expected on EU research & innovation projects, as the participation of China in Horizon 2020 is low.

Medium-term impacts:
• A strong decrease in overall mobility across countries and places in the EU occurs, also for researchers and innovators operating outside of restricted areas, and this has a moderate impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity, which is largely based on such mobility.
• Regular postponement and cancellation of scientific events (including health research related conferences), clear overload of health professionals (with a detrimental effect on their research work) and recurrent delays and cancellation in clinical trials. All those are very likely to have a significant impact on scientific developments in the short to the medium run.
• Strong impact on global innovation networks and - depending on how the situation evolves - potential delays and a reduction of activities. China, US & Germany host the world’s largest R&D investor firms that perform R&D activities away from headquarters. Large impact expected on the activities of those R&D investors and on the work in related R&D labs.

Long-term impacts:
• There is a very large estimated loss of total public & private EU R&D investments of -1.3% (€3.9bn) in 2020.
• The mobility of human resources in science, technology and innovation (including visiting researchers, staff exchanges) is marginal or close to zero, focusing only on a very limited set of health professionals that do research. This has a durable negative impact on Europe’s scientific production, breakthroughs and the translation of scientific outcomes into solutions, which will be very hard to reverse over the medium term, as national science capacity is built very progressively.
• The impact of the outbreak on global innovation networks is very strong with particularly hard impact expected on the activities of large R&D investors (which are largely preforming their R&D activities outside of EU headquarters) and on the work in related R&D labs. This is particularly noticeable in countries such as Germany which host many of those large R&D investing companies and labs. Innovation processes will slowdown as employees in R&D labs and testing facilities may have to stay home.
• Among the 4 most affected third countries by COVID-19 (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran), 3 fall within the 20 most active countries in Horizon 2020. The impact of the outbreak under this scenario is larger for Horizon 2020, given that the 4 most affected countries represent 15% of the ongoing participations of the third countries in the programme. Actions under Horizon 2020 that imply networking of research groups will be more impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak.
• All major scientific events get postponed or cancelled (including health research related conferences), the overload of health professionals impedes them from doing any research work, and most clinical trials get cancelled. This scenario has major significant impacts on scientific developments in the medium run.","Research and innovation (R&I) play an essential role in the response to the Covid-19 outbreak. They are also critical levers to ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery, while boosting the resilience of our production sectors, the competitiveness of our economies and the transformation of our socio-economic systems. Research and innovation actions are an essential part of the coordinated EU response to the public health threat of Covid-19. They channel public and private investments and align funding and investment streams to underpin the Recovery. In the current context, we need science-driven solutions, including better scientific understanding of the virus as well as the development of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. R&I also provides the technologies that allow for safer and faster tracking of the virus. In global emergencies, such as the Covid19 pandemic, it is essential to remove all obstacles to the free flow of data, researchers and ideas. Full, timely and fair access to scientific information and research results during crises for researchers, journalists, medical staff and all citizens is of outmost importance for accurate and affordable science-based responses. Moreover, openly accessible, machine-readable, interoperable data is needed to follow the spread of the epidemic, and forecast its rapid evolution. Key datasets include clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data. It is of crucial importance to invest in stronger and more resilient national health systems, capable of rapid and integrated responses drawing on the latest scientific discoveries, with equal access across the EU. ","Research & innovation (R&I) play a key role in the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly in provision of quick science driven solutions including better scientific understanding of the virus as well as development of treatments and diagnostics.

Health system’s capacities make a difference in terms of response to outbreaks.  Therefore, it is of paramount importance to invest in making national health systems stronger, more resilient and capable of a rapid and integrated response drawing on the latest scientific discoveries, ensuring equal access to healthcare across the EU. Horizon Europe plans to support R&I activities aimed at strengthening health system’s resilience.

In the “post-covid world” we have three scenarios: (1) A return to business as usual? (2) “Normality” with “lessons- learned”? and (3) The dawn of a radically different reality? There are risks and opportunities coming from this crisis. On the one hand, climate transition is at risk, the return of state intervention or of state surveillance, or de-globalisation. On the other hand, the opportunities include the rise of self-organization and collective intelligence, knowledge sharing, social innovation, and a boom in solidarity. All these aspects impact society as well, for instance, in terms of individual freedom, impact of social distancing, the future of mobility, higher demand for transparency, government distrust, change of consumption patterns, among many others. This calls for foresight practices to look into the impacts on societies and the economy."

","The government is stressing in all of its communication the scientific base of its Corona actions and encourages citizens to follow its website (https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus) and the website of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) (https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates), which provide up-to-date comprehensive information on the coronavirus. The Government website contains decisions by the Government, information produced by the ministries on the effects of the coronavirus on different administrative sectors as well as topical material on the coronavirus from all ministries.

For general information inquiries on the coronavirus a phone number (with chat function) has been set up. The information service is open on weekdays at 8–21 and Saturdays at 9–15.","Please note that the response to this question is overlapping somewhat with the issues asked in question 6. We often find it difficult to make a difference between the actions and stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy in general and on the innovation system in particular. Here is a summary of Covid-19 –related measures, organized by the authority responsible for the measures.

1) The Bank of Finland made decisions on 15 March 2020 on measures aimed at alleviating payment difficulties and liquidity shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring access to funding for households and businesses, particularly SMEs. The decisions were prepared in cooperation with the Government and key authorities, and in dialogue with the financial sector. They complement the decisions taken earlier by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) to support favourable liquidity conditions and preserve the smooth provision of credit in the euro area.

The Bank of Finland assesses, in close cooperation with national, European and Nordic authorities, the stability of the financial system and, in particular, developments in financial intermediation. The purpose is to facilitate the ability of credit institutions to provide funding to businesses and households and to mitigate the negative economic impact of the pandemic. The Board of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) has started work on an immediate review of the level of capital requirements that are subject to national decision-making.

In 2009–2018, the Bank of Finland invested in the domestic corporate paper market. This investment activity was discontinued as market volumes shrank, reflecting the decrease in funding needs of businesses. Recent events have weakened the ability of markets to function and increased the funding needs of businesses. The Bank of Finland has therefore decided to restart its activities in the domestic corporate paper markets. The size of the programme was initially EUR 500 million. A few days later, the size of the programme was increased to EUR 1 billion due to huge demand.

2) The Tax Administration will ease the terms of payment arrangements for the time being. If a company has difficulties paying taxes due to the coronavirus situation, it can request a payment arrangement with eased terms starting 25 March 2020. For example, according to the new terms, the first installment of the payment arrangement will fall due in three months after the arrangement has become active, as opposed to just one month.

3) The Government decided on 20 March on an extensive package to support companies and to alleviate the negative effects of the coronavirus epidemic (See press release: https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/hallitukselta-mittava-paketti-yritysten-tueksi-finnveran-kautta-10-miljardin-euron-lisarahoitus-yrityksille). 
According to a government decision, 1,500 foreign seasonal workers can be employed to perform agricultural, forestry, horticultural and fishery work. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has provided the Finnish Border Guard a list of the most critical employees in terms of security of supply.  Legislative amendments to legislation concerning the right of third-country nationals to work in duties central to the security of supply and the functioning of the labour market entered into force on 9 April 2020.

4) Ministry of Social Affairs and Health: The Government submitted the first supplementary budget proposal for 2020 to Parliament on 20 March. An additional appropriation of EUR 12.8 million is proposed for the operating expenses of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare for the expenditure arising from the coronavirus. The additional appropriation is intended for purposes such as disseminating information and raising awareness among citizens, for safeguarding the functioning of information systems and for maintaining laboratory capacity. Altogether, EUR 6 million of the additional appropriation will be allocated to a broad-based research consortium for research into the coronavirus epidemic, in particular for developing rapid diagnostic methods and research into the emergence of immunity and for creating a national monitoring system for it. Of the additional funding allocated to research, EUR 4 million will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.


5) Organisations operating in the field of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE Group) monitor the effects of the coronavirus on businesses, employment, consumers and security of supply. The Ministry together with other organisations in the MEAE Group, monitors the effects of the coronavirus on business activities, employment and security of supply, and takes the necessary measures to alleviate the negative impacts. All the relevant general information about the coronavirus and the authorities’ actions and responses can be found from the following website: https://tem.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus

In negotiations held on 13 May 2020, the Government decided to introduce a new form of support to businesses in all industries to cover their costs. The support is intended for companies that have experienced a marked decrease in turnover due to the coronavirus epidemic, and have costs that are difficult to adjust. Support is allocated to companies and sectors most severely affected by the coronavirus.

In the field of STI, it includes the following (newest at the top):

On 8 April the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment announced that it is seeking to ensure that businesses will be able to continue operating on a profitable basis after the coronavirus crisis is over.

Additional EUR 450 million from the supplementary budget to support businesses. The additional funding is aimed at ensuring that sufficient resources are allocated for both coronavirus-related financing already in use by Business Finland and the Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment and for the support of sole entrepreneurs, to be introduced in the near future. Of this increase, EUR 100 million is intended for support provided by Business Finland, EUR 200 million for support provided by the Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment, and EUR 150 million for the support of sole entrepreneurs.

As a whole, support for businesses during the coronavirus crisis will increase to EUR 1.45 billion, of which Business Finland support account for EUR 800 million. The Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment will receive EUR 400 million and sole entrepreneurs, EUR 250 million

6) Business Finland (https://www.businessfinland.fi/en/for-finnish-customers/home/)
Business Finland’s grant authorisations will be increased by EUR 150 million to permit immediate business support measures.
On 19 March 2020, Business Finland launched two new financial services to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic. These services are intended for SMEs and midcaps operating in Finland whose business is suffering from the coronavirus situation. Financial services are intended for at least tourism and auxiliary tourism services, creative and performing industries and all sectors where subcontracting chains are affected. The funding is intended for companies to explore and tap into new business opportunities in emergency conditions. The first funding decisions were made immediately on 20 March 2020.

7) Finnvera (https://www.finnvera.fi/eng/)
The Government will make additional financing of EUR 10 billion available to businesses through Finnvera. The principal operating model is offering guarantees to banks that grant loans. In addition, the state will increase its coverage of Finnvera’s credit and guarantee losses from 50% to 80%.

8) ELY Centres (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) (https://www.ely-keskus.fi/en/web/ely-en/)
ELY Centres’ grant authorisations for business development projects will be increased by EUR 50 million. The additional authorisation will be used to support SMEs particularly in the service sector but also in other sectors as necessary to manage and prevent the effects of the coronavirus.

9) VTT – Technical Research Center (https://www.vttresearch.com/en)
VTT is responding to corona virus in various ways, including the following:

9.1 Responding to customer needs in exceptional circumstances
Through active and continuous communication, VTT enables the understanding of customer needs even in exceptional circumstances. All customer meetings have been converted to online meetings. Plans to help clients monitor the progress of their daily experimental work at VTT, for example, have been developed and are being implemented. VTT's new, streamlined website has been launched. In addition, social media and other digital marketing channels are actively used for communication. As an example, VTT utilizes webinars and recordings of VTT researchers' presentations to enable scientific exchange despite the prevailing conditions.

9.2 Immediate RTD actions to assist Finnish society during covid-19
During the Corona pandemic, VTT sees opportunities to participate in a joint national effort by leveraging the organization's expertise and available infrastructure. VTT has identified capabilities that would provide immediate national support for the Corona effort, as well as expertise that will bring significant benefits over the next year. Recognized examples include some with immediate effect, some requiring more time and also additional investments.

9.3 Measures to mitigate the economic shock and support national competitiveness
VTT has started planning how VTT's research resources can be harnessed to maintain Finland's competitiveness in this exceptional situation. As client assignments fade, VTT's freed up researcher resources can be utilized (subject to an increase in state aid) for strategic themes and projects that benefit Finnish industry and society and revitalize economic growth. VTT has the capability to launch such research projects quickly. The themes will not only address the challenges posed by the corona situation in terms of industrial competitiveness and security of supply, but will also continue to focus on providing solutions to the long-term challenges of carbon neutrality and the circular economy. Innovations related to these themes will also benefit Finland after the immediate corona crisis eased.


10) The Academy of Finland is making available funding for Covid-19 research (3 million euros) The aims of the funding to be granted for research into the COVID-19 epidemic are:
• to support research in the field and/or
• to improve open access to research data and outputs for researchers and society and/or
• to promote the use of research knowledge in mitigating the effects and/or
• to promote the utilisation of research-based knowledge and expertise.
The call is a targeted call intended for organisations. The organisation’s application consists of sub-applications. The sub-applications are based on the work of ongoing Academy-funded projects, which will ensure that activities can start as soon as possible. The plans of the sub-applications must be relevant to the theme of the call. The principal investigators of the sub-applications must have an ongoing Academy-funded research project on the closing date of the call.
The assessment will focus on how the plans are based on the work of the projects, their relevance to the theme of the call and whether the plan can be credibly implemented considering the current situation. The General Subcommittee of the Academy of Finland will make the funding decisions.

Additional information:
In June 2013, under the aegis of the Alliance for Life Sciences and Health,* France launched a consortium called REACTing: REsearch and ACTion targeting emerging infectious diseases. This consortium is organized around a steering committee of 15 human and animal health specialists; it is supported by an 8-member scientific committee and methodological centers. REACTing does not target any particular disease, and can intervene in all infectious emergencies. Its field of action is wide, from basic research to the humanities and social sciences, including the environmental sciences, epidemiology and public health. The approach is transversal and multidisciplinary, because health crises are always complex phenomena in their causes as in their effects.

REACTing has multiple objectives:
• Improve the preparation of research in times of inter-crisis (peacetime): governance, preparation of research tools, identification of research priorities, search for funding, and preparation of the ethical and legal aspects essential for anticipation research projects to be built in an emergency.
• Coordinate, finance and set up research projects in times of epidemic crisis: coordination, scientific and strategic priorities, methodological assistance, information for authorities and the general public.
• Help with public decision-making and reaffirm the place of research in the response to health problems, alongside aspects of care, logistics, security and geopolitics.

Germany,2020-04-06 12:48:47.000,"Germany recently changed the German Infection Protection Act that is the legal basis for protective measures against health crises. According to the federalist principle, the German federal states have so far been the competent authority to implement the law. Within the division of responsibilities in Germany’s federal system, in case of a pandemic the German Federation used to have a coordinating role, promoting a unified approach to fighting the pandemic and running public information campaigns, and making recommendations to the federal states. 
However, in order to effectively protect the nation against the spread of the new coronavirus, the federal government has now been given the right to intervene quickly with protective measures, and can also restrict fundamental rights, such as freedom of assembly or freedom of movement. The regulation is limited to one year and will be subject to thorough reevaluation.

Based on the German Federal Government’s pandemic preparedness plan, a crisis task force jointly led by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI) and German Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) gathers all ministry-specific competences for combating the national threat posed by coronavirus (COVID-19).  As well as the BMI and BMG, the task force includes representatives of the German Federal Foreign Office, the German Federal Ministry of Defense, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, the German Federal Ministry of Finance, the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and the German Federal Chancellery.

The recently adopted G7 Leaders’ statement expresses “our conviction that current challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic need a strongly coordinated international approach, based on science and evidence, consistent with our democratic values, and utilizing the strengths of private enterprise.” The G7 “will increase coordinated research efforts, including through voluntary support for the global alliance Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation.  We will support the launch of joint research projects funded by both public and private resources, and the sharing of facilities, towards rapid development, manufacture and distribution of treatments and a vaccine, adhering to the principles of efficacy, safety, and accessibility.”

Germany urges to increase investment in research and development for new vaccines, therapies and diagnostics, to strengthen international cooperation and to follow the recommendations of WHO. Germany, for example, invites G20 countries to also support the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in their effort to develop a vaccine against SARS-Cov2. The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research decided to support CEPI with an additional 140 million € to support R&D on new vaccines against Covid-19.

Germany exchanges information with other international state or philanthropic sponsors under the WHO umbrella in order to achieve the most targeted and coordinated investment possible for the research funds available worldwide. The co-operation with the “Global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness network” (GloPID-R) is most relevant (see: https://www.glopid-r.org/our-work/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/).
","Germany is aware of the need to avoid the dissemination of fake news and through the media and to intensify risk communication for the general public as well as for health care professionals. Therefore, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research has set up a topic page about fake news and the new coronadisease COVID-19. As the virus spreads around the world, Germany is aware of the importance of getting accurate information about the disease. To combat misinformation, the webpage is updated whenever the need arises and this information is spread through social media channels to counteract false information: https://www.bmbf.de/de/faktencheck-zum-coronavirus-11162.html","The German Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) has provided 9,574 Mio. € to support (Federal) Research Institutes in the fight against Corona. The research activities aim at
• Supporting the national fight against the spread of the virus

The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research launched a Call on Corona on 3rd March 2020. See https://www.gesundheitsforschung-bmbf.de/de/10592.php
(see for English version https://www.dlr.de/pt/Portaldata/45/Resources/Dokumente/GF/2020_03_02_Call_announcement_covid19.pdf). In the meantime, the budget of this Call has been increased to 15 Mio. €. The Call is structured in different modules:
• Module 1 - Combating COVID-19 through early clinical studies for the application of already known therapeutic approaches to Sars-CoV-2
• Module 2 - Control of COVID-19 through new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches
• Module 3 - Research that contributes to the understanding of the virus and its spread
• Module 4 - Support of already ongoing research projects on corona viruses

Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG): On 19th of March 2020, the DFG launched a Call on interdisciplinary research on epidemics and pandemics. Projects will be funded that address prevention, early detection and containment or research on the causes, consequences and handling of epidemics and pandemics looking at SARS-CoV-2 and other human-pathogenic microorganisms and viruses (see: https://www.dfg.de/service/presse/berichte/2020/200318_corona_news/).

Horizon 2020 (European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation): Germany is, for example, taking part in a Marie-Curie-project to overcome the species barriers of coronavirus (see: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/748627); a collaborative project on immunotherapy for rotavirus and coronavirus infections (see: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/748627); and a collaborative European-Chinese project on the diagnosis of coronaviruses using the example of SARS (see: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/3831)

","The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research is funding the development of a research network with 150 Mio. € in order to bundle and strengthen the research activities of German university medicine in the context of the current pandemic crisis. The initiative shall bring together and evaluate the action plans, diagnostic and treatment strategies of all German university clinics. At all university hospitals, the data of the treated COVID-19 patients are also systematically recorded and bundled in a database. In this way, the medical histories or data on the constitution of the patients can be merged. Scientists who are not active in medical research can also gain access to this data collection. Their research will support the work of doctors. The data set will help generate valid and useful knowledge on the individual treatment of patients, pandemic management, but also with regard to vaccine and therapy development. The Federal Government will set up a task force. The task force will coordinate university medicine and politics. Various other scientific networks are also to be included.","The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research decided to support CEPI with an additional 140 Mio. € to support R&D on new vaccines against Covid-19.
The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research is collaborating with other funders under the roof of the WHO in the international funders network GloPID-R (see: https://www.glopid-r.org/ourwork/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/) in order to coordinate investments in research and development. 

The German Federal Ministry of Health will provide WHO with additional financial support of 50 Mio. € for Covid-19. 

The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development will increase measures of German bilateral and regional cooperation with reserve funds to the amount of € 20.82 million and will also examine further possibilities for short-term technical and financial support for the partner countries of German development cooperation. The regional focus is Africa. 
","Given the highly dynamic situation we are currently not aware of specific novel technical approaches.

OECD Secretariat additions (30 March 2020):
The Federal Government co-sponsored a 48-hour virtual Covid-19 hackathon on 20-22 March 2020 (WirVsVirus, https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) aimed at developing solutions to problems related to the Covid-19 crisis (e.g. How to organise neighbourhood assistance through helper platforms? How to track corona-infected, tested and recovered persons?). It had over 40,000 participants that worked on 810 projects organized around 49 themes.","In the short term, there is a need for an “emergency funding for R&I” to fully mobilize, involve and interconnect the available research capacities throughout Germany, Europe and the rest of the world. Evaluation and funding decisions should be fast and the bureaucratic burden of applicants must be minimized. All options for making project funding more flexible are to be used until further notice. The researchers and laboratories as well as the SMEs that are already active in the development of vaccines, drugs, diagnostics and treatment need financial support. If successful, support should be continued in the medium term to advance candidate products through clinical development. Also, immediate sharing of results and more urgently available data is crucial.

In the medium term, the contribution of digitization in the fight against virus pandemics is essential. Supercomputers and big data can effectively improve the simulation of disease spreading or the automatization of the analysis of targets for new drugs and treatments. Preparedness networks, e.g. of researchers, hospitals, clinics and diagnostic laboratories, should receive continuous funding in order to have structures in place to rapidly respond to outbreaks.

In the long term, more basic and bottom-up research in virology end epidemiology is required. Sufficient support for fundamental research in life sciences and biomedicine as well as platform technologies should be mobilized.
","The Federal Government announced several measures to stabilize the economy which are of a historic dimension. The latest information can be found here: https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/coronavirus-1725960

First of all, that package seeks to ease liquidity shortages and help companies of all sizes and sectors to secure their survival, employment and assets. While it is clear that research and innovation continue to be of vital importance for economic growth and recovery, measures geared toward the STI system are identified comprehensively and will be further elaborated shortly.

Greece,2020-05-07 14:00:15.000,"Covid-19 relevant activities are coordinated by an inter-ministerial Committee, headed by the Vice Minister for Civil Protection and Crisis Management. Others participating in the Committee include representatives of the Prime Minister's Cabinet, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Health, the General Secretariat of Civil Protection, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Development and Investments.

As far as scientific advice is concerned, an Expert Committee has been established under the authority of the Ministry of Health, comprising immunologists, epidemiologists, experts on infectious diseases, statisticians and mathematicians.
","Greece participates to the relevant activities and organs of the European Union, the World Health Organization and other international organizations.

The Greek Government has nominated as official representative to the International Organizations for coronavirus issues, Professor Elias Mossialos, (Head of Department of Health Policy and Director of LSE Health at the London School of Economics). 
","Official information and scientific advice to the public is delivered daily from the mass media. Facts, data, scientific information (including alerts on fake news and rumors), measures and recommendations are provided by the Chair of the Expert Committee (see responses to Question 1), Professor Sotiris Tsiodras (University of Athens, Medical School), the representatives of the General Secretariat of Civil Protection, and other representatives of the Greek Government. There is considerable social pressure, raised through social media, to silence divergent opinions contradicting mainstream government policy and proposing different approaches to management of the outbreak. Similarly, the electronic marketing of products promoted as protecting from the virus is socially condemned. Αll the political spectrum stands behind this government action.

Citizens can also get sound information and guidance directly from the National Public Health Organization (Ministry of Health) (https://eody.gov.gr/neos-koronaios-covid-19/) through a 24-hour available phone line. 
","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the General Secretariat for Research and Technology of Greece launched a Flagship Research Action entitled “Epidemiological study in Greece through extensive testing for virus and antibody detection, viral genome sequencing and genetic analysis of patients, in response to the SARS-CoV-2 crisis”. 

The Action is expected is expected to provide answers to the following questions: 
1. Given the global spread of the virus and the possible shortage of reagents, will Greece be able to respond successfully to the increased demand for virus detection tests as well as antibody tests, particularly as containment measures are gradually lifted? 
2. Despite identification of high-risk groups (seniors and people with underlying conditions), predictability of outcome for individual patients remains relatively low. Are there factors like genetic susceptibility which could help in this regard? 
3. Which are the transmission patterns of the virus and which are the predominant virus strains among the Greek population? 
4. Which will be the immunity levels of the population and of each patient after the pandemic? 

The Action will be implemented by four (4) higher education institutions and six (6) research centres. Greek research centres and university laboratories, working together with the medical community, have the privilege to be ideally positioned, at international level, to conduct this study, which is expected not only to have a direct impact within Greece in the immediate future, but also to put Greece at the vanguard of global advances in understanding and tackling SARS-CoV-2.

The Flagship Research Action has a pubic budget of € 2.475 m under National Public  Investments Programme.

More detailed information about the Flagship Action is given in the following link:
gsrt.gr/central.aspx?sId=124I458I1163I323I509672&olID=777&neID=589&neTa=1_122365&ncID=0&neHC=0&tbid=0&lrID=2&oldUIID=aI777I0I119I428I1089I0I3&actionID=load

Further initiatives undertaken by Greek Research organizations are as follows:

1) Testing for the virus is done by the Hellenic Pasteur Institute (https://www.pasteur.gr), the national COVid-19 Reference Centre. Testing is up until now limited to those with serious symptoms. It is not possible to extend testing to the symptom-free population, mainly due to shortages in reagents and essential consumables. Epidemiological data are stored for all samples. However, it is still early days for concrete epidemiological studies. 

2) Several Greek public Research Centers and Universities have joined forces to contribute to the national effort to broaden testing of the population under an initiative of the National Council for Research & Innovation and the National Public Health Organization. This plan has not been fully implemented yet until all biosafety requirements are met and all controls are completed. As a first phase, the plan includes the Laboratory of Hygiene and Epidemiology of the University of Athens (https://dehems.med.uoa.gr), the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens (https://www.bioacademy.gr/) and the Institute of Applied Biosciences at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (https://www.inab.certh.gr/). Further research entities are also appropriately equipped in order to detect SARS-COV-2 by real time PCR, such as, for example, the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH) (https://www.imbb.forth.gr/). The latter has also developed an innovative technology based on biosensors for the direct detection of virus particles of SARS-COV-2. They are in consultation with the Reference Centre of the Pasteur Institute in order to perform tests. A spin-off company has been created by FORTH for the next steps and exploitation of research results. 

3) There are important research activities in the field of biology of viruses (among them the family of coronaviruses) along with the reaction of the human immune system to viral infections. Such research is mostly undertaken at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology / FORTH, but also at the other biomedical research Institutes. Substantial work is also being done in the field of epidemiological modelling of the virus spread dynamics with mathematical and computer models. 

4) On treatment for COVID-19, Greece is already implementing a strategy of drug-repositioning / re-purposing for already approved drugs. Several research groups along with enterprises are working in this field.
",No specific mechanisms are in place so far. Coordination is under the responsibility of the Inter-ministerial Committee (see answers to question 1).,"At the European level, as for the priorities for EU coordinated R&I action for COVID19, we support the initiatives and actions taken by the European Commission, especially on vaccines and treatment. We welcome the dedicated call of the Health Program with a budget of 47,5 M€. "," A detailed analysis of the most important  R&D activities related to COVID 19 in the Greek research centers and Universities is given below:

HELLENIC PASTEUR INSTITUTE
The Hellenic Pasteur Institute (HPI) - recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), a member of the European Reference Laboratory Network for Human Influenza (ECDCERLI-Net) and a member of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS-WHO) - has been designated as National Reference Center for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
In the context of its mission to promote scientific knowledge and innovation, HPI has launched research studies seeking to understand the mode of action, pathogenetic mechanisms and epidemiology of this novel coronavirus, and develop new diagnostic tools and treatment methods.
Building on the well-established know-how and experience on infectious diseases of its internationally renowned research departments of Microbiology, Immunology and Neurobiology, and Reference Laboratories for infectious diseases, the HPI has planned the following actions: 
1. Banking of clinical samples from patients infected with SARS- CoV-2 (use and further development of existing bank).
2. Development, modelling and certification of antibody detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 to monitor buildup of immunity in the population and the factors having an influence on it; isolation and identification of neutralizing antibodies from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and development of diagnostic methodologies, e.g. seroneutralisation, to detect specific immunity. For this Action, the HPI will collaborate closely with the Pasteur Institute in Paris, a globally recognized leader in infectious diseases research.
3. Study of the virological profile, and investigation for presence of defective SARS-CoV-2 forms in serum samples or smears from recovered or deceased patients. This action is expected to contribute to the laboratory assessment of disease outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.
4. Study of SARS-CoV-2 patients’ immune response using traditional immunological methods as well as next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. There are already experimental data that SARS-CoV-2 triggers a specific immune response, which differs from that of other related viruses. Viral infection has dramatic effects on the gene expression profile, primarily of immune-system cells. This HPI projects aims at developing specialized treatments for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
5. Sequencing of the virus genome based on patient samples with a view to studying the molecular evolution of the virus in the Greek population and correlating mutations/polymorphisms with severity of the disease in order to identify highly pathogenic strains. Our goal is to analyze a large number of samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients in Greece in order to achieve full characterization of viral genomes, their host heterogeneity and create a map of the virus spread using phylogeographical analysis.
6. Study of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with human nerve cells and its effects on the brain. It has been found that a percentage of severely affected patients experience neurological problems. Most recent data show that SARS-CoV-2 may invade the central nervous system in multiple ways.

BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH CENTRE (BSRC) “ALEXANDER FLEMING”
With public health as one of its top priorities, BSRC Fleming supports the National Health System and the community by engaging in three specific actions to support diagnostic and research approaches against COVID-19:
• Participating in efforts to detect the virus in biological samples using the Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) facilities available at the Center: BSRC Fleming possesses the necessary technological infrastructure to support diagnostic tests and to participate in the improvement of existing, or the development of new, tests that will address immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
• Supporting research aimed at understanding viral pathology, by providing experimental animal models that are relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, inflammation and the neurotropism of the virus. Specifically, Fleming can provide pre-existing animal models or, based on emerging needs from current clinical studies of the virus, generate novel animal models through its specialized units. Additionally, utilizing platforms for the identification of clinical, cellular and molecular markers it can undertake the characterization of underlying clinical, genetic and epigenetic factors that are associated with susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
• Providing technical expertise and the necessary bioinformatics tools required to analyse viral genetic material in the Greek population towards identification of potential variants associated with increased transmission or virulence. In addition, the Center can apply combinatorial bioinformatic methods on data from patient sample analyses to discover biological markers of the disease, as well as aid in drug repurposing. BSRC Fleming’s researchers are already collaborating with international teams in basic research projects to discover therapeutic targets by modelling and analysing viral – host protein interaction networks. All data from these actions will be freely available to the scientific community in order to accelerate research against COVID-19.
• At the European level, Fleming participates in efforts to tackle the pandemic as coordinator of two National Research Infrastructures, InfrafrontierGR and ELIXIR-GR, and as a core partner of their respective European networks INFRAFRONTIER and ELIXIR, that are already engaged in actions against COVID-19.

BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF THE ACADEMY OF ATHENS (BRFAA)
The Academy of Athens emphasizes that successfully addressing the pandemic and implementing a crisis exit strategy necessitates intensive research efforts to understand the biology and epidemiology of the virus, and to develop treatments and vaccines. The Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens (BRFAA), acknowledging the critical character of the situation, contributes to this effort with its specialized scientific staff and state-of-the-art research facilities. More specifically, BRFAA: 
a) has launched a molecular diagnostic testing initiative for detection of the virus in the population;
b) is monitoring biomarkers of inflammation and immune response in order to select the appropriate treatment for patients in intensive-care units;
c) has planned surveys on immunity buildup in the population through detection of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2;
d) is currently modelling biological material collections from COVID-19 patients, in order to conduct studies aimed at understanding the molecular evolution of the virus in the Greek population and the interaction of the virus with human cells to identify new drug targets; and
e) explores the connection between the global effects of the coronavirus crisis and the prevailing climate-environmental conditions, in collaboration with the Research Centre for Atmospheric Physics and Climatology (RCAPC) of the Academy of Athens.
Moreover, the Research Centre of Pure and Applied Mathematics (RCPAM) of the Academy of Athens, a BRFAA partner, has developed reliable predictive models of virus spread, which will be useful for planning long-term pandemic management. Collaborating BRFAA develops animal models to study infection and inflammation in order to understand the pathogenic mechanism of viral infection.
Regarding treatment of COVID-19 patients, the competent members of the Academy of Athens, particularly intensive-care specialists, offer valuable medical guidance to the medical and nursing staff to address the pandemic.

NATIONAL CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (NCSR) “DEMOKRITOS”
Virus Detection
• The NCSR “Demokritos” provides infrastructure and develops appropriate methodologies for conducting virus detection tests in biological fluids, to help control the virus spread. 
Antibody Detection – Qualitative Assessment of Immunity
• Development of biosensors for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples in collaboration with ThetaMetrisis (a NCSR “Demokritos” spin-off). Having already developed and patented optical-sensor technological platforms for critical inflammation markers directly related to COVID-19 disease, the NCSR “Demokritos” is currently evaluating these sensors with a view to achieving rapid, accurate and simultaneous identification of IgG/IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient serum. Following completion of their preclinical and clinical evaluation, it will soon be possible to standardize the sensors in order to be able to cover the country’s needs.
• Development and production of innovative diagnostic kits for qualitative assessment of population immunity by a “Lefkippos” Attica Technology Park company in collaboration with “Demokritos” research laboratories. The main competitive advantage of this kit, which is currently in the final stages of production, is the simultaneous measurement of many immunity parameters, resulting to less false-positive results. Next steps are the final qualitative assessment of the kit to be conducted after the imminent reception of patient samples, and the file submission to the Greek National Organisation of Medicines (EOF). Following completion of clinical results, the diagnostic kits could become available to accredited centres in Greece which will be able to measure population immunity at a low-cost. At the same time, discussions are under way for potentially making the kit available internationally.
New Experimental Treatments
• Participation in multidisciplinary team of researchers, immunologists and clinical experts from the USA, Italy and Germany responsible for designing a clinical trial to evaluate a new experimental treatment for COVID-19 patients. The study will be coordinated by Greek pharmaceutical start-up Amyndas Pharmaceuticals and will assess whether the targeted inhibition of the complement system, a key component of innate immunity, can limit uncontrollable inflammation resulting in acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.
Research Actions
• Research action to study the way antigenic peptides are generated from SARS-CoV-2 proteins, based on prior knowledge of the mechanisms used by the immune system to recognize infected cells. This action seeks to reveal important aspects of the human body defense mechanism against SARS-CoV-2 and find new ways to boost it.
• Design and development of SARS-CoV-2 protein inhibitors to prevent virus replication.
• Participation in the epidemiological study, coordinated by the GSRT, involving SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and genetic analysis of patients. This study, to be conducted by a partnership of research laboratories, will produce important databases which, combined with similar international initiatives, will be a springboard to innovative computational studies using Artificial Intelligence. The NCSR ”Demokritos” will be responsible for development of the data management and analytics system.
Digital Applications
• Implementation of the BioASQ project, coordinated by NCSR “Demokritos”, which organises international competitions (challenges) for systems of biomedical information retrieval and automatic answering of relevant scientific questions from databases. In this context and with a view to promoting scientific research on COVID-19 disease, “Demokritos” launches a challenge which will use the AI software tools of the BioASQ project to answer scientific questions on the coronavirus. Through this process, our goal is to facilitate understanding of COVID-19 and contribute to finding new solutions.
• Utilization of the NCSR “Demokritos” Social Web Observatory for social science to study and analyze dissemination of COVID-19 information in the community (social media and news broadcasts). The analysis results will be made public to allow a real-time assessment of the confinement measures impact and to support policy planning.
Materials for protective equipment
• Providing fully available high-granularity infrastructure for measurement and recording of aerosol particles containing the virus, by size and concentration. This unit has been tested and can provide results for characterization of semi-permeable materials (e.g. masks) with sufficient respirability for human use in terms of their filtration capacity of micro- and nano-particles potentially carrying the virus. Performance of common materials has already been evaluated in comparison to standard-specification masks (Ν95, FFP1, 2, 3).
Air Quality
• Data from research stations monitoring atmospheric parameters are also examined and analyzed to assess changes in air quality as a result of the escalating restrictions on movement and decrease of related economic activities.

FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-HELLAS (FORTH)

FORTH / INSTITUTE OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY (IMBB):
• The Heraklion-based IMBB provides appropriate equipment and infrastructures for SARS-CoV-2 detection, applying reliable molecular virus identification methods (RT-PCR) with a potential for wide diagnostic use.
• MINOTECH, the IMBB in-house production facility, is already producing molecular biology consumables (Taq polymerase, Reverse Transcriptase) used for RT/RQPCR, available throughout Greece and abroad (a MINOTECH and FORTH spin-off Enzyquest collaboration).
• Researchers at IMBB have been developing, modelling and using an innovative methodology for molecular identification of the virus based on biosensors, which could be used in near-patient points of care (e.g. mobile medical units, airports, ports, private medical practices, etc.). It is an adaptable and efficient method, unique on a global scale, which will be exploited by the newly established FORTH spin-off BIOPIX. Evaluation of its accuracy and reliability is under way in collaboration with COVID-19 reference centres.
• Using its state-of-the-art genomic analysis infrastructures (FORTH is a hub of the Hellenic Networks of Precision/Personalized Medicine and operates the only laboratory for ancient DNA analysis in Greece), IMBB is able to fully analyze the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, in order to map and trace the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Greece. Obtaining this information will be extremely helpful also for characterization of the different virus types present on the Greek territory, as well as determination of their geographical origin. 
In a recent study (Population genomics insights into the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2), researchers from IMBB and ICS/FORTH used population genetics analysis to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Their results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, they  find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, they infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts.  In addition, they estimated the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and they demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.054122v1)

FORTH / IMBB BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH DIVISION (IMBB-BR)

• The ICS has developed @HOME, a specific application for monitoring the health status of COVID-19 patients while they remain at home. The @HOME system comprises a very simple app for smart phones offered to patients and a desktop application destined for the medical monitoring team. Via the smart-phone app, the patient receives reminders and communicates with the medical team, while having access to valid information on COVID-19. The medical team receives continuous feedback on the health status of all registered patients and is thus able to intervene in time, where required. The system was developed under the ICS Ambient Intelligence activities.
• The ICS Information Systems Laboratory has offered use of the CAPrice platform (https://www.capricecommunity.net/), a crowdsourcing solution for monitoring privacy protection, to the international initiative Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), in the context of software application use for tracing contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases.
• The ICS-FORTH Center for eHealth Applications and Services (CeHA) provides technical support to reference hospitals (Thriasio General Hospital of Eleusina, Pammakaristos General Hospital, University Regional General Hospital of Patras, etc.).
• The ICS-FORTH Center for eHealth Applications and Services (CeHA) offers its software application suite “Integrated Care Solutions (ICS)”, which has been supporting numerous health units in their day-to-day operations attending to the needs of thousands of citizens since 2000. Specific applications are now available in international markets. In hospitals, the ICS suite is used by administrative personnel as well as medical and nursing staff in clinics and medical offices for management of patients and their medical records. It is interconnected with third-party systems (National organization for health care services - EOPYY, e-Government Center for Social Security Services – IDIKA, Ministry of Health, etc.) supporting automation of administrative and medical operations (ordering of laboratory tests and receiving their results, data sending, provision of EOPYY services, interconnection with IDIKA ATLAS system, e-Prescribing, etc.) and transferring technology and knowledge in points of care.

NATIONAL OBSERVATORY OF ATHENS (NOA)
The National Observatory of Athens, in an effort to support State authorities in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, has been developing and providing services ensuring continuous monitoring of the spatial distribution of confirmed cases and deaths, both in Greece and on a global level. Furthermore, it has been designing a number of experiments and surveys on the related atmospheric and weather conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of confinement measures on research areas of NOA competence, that is air pollution, air permeability, measurement of actual seismic background noise (without contribution from human activities), etc. Below we present the services introduced and the experiments and surveys under way, some of which have already yielded results, announced below (to be followed by specific Press releases with detailed results), while others are still underway and have yet to yield results. 
A. Services:
• Information platform for continuous monitoring of worldwide COVID-19 status, with spatial granularity. A system of timely information and assessment with regard to virus spread was developed by the Operational Unit of Earth Observation and Satellite Remote Sensing Sciences under the BEYOND project, hosted at the NOA Institute of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing (IAASARS) and is freely available online. Specifically for Greece, it supports collection of data from municipalities and registry offices, and presents additional data collected by BEYOND/Hellenic National Sentinel Data Mirror Site, including socioeconomic, environmental and atmospheric parameters. 
• Β. Experiments which are underway and have already yielded initial results:
• Study on the “profile” of pollution sources during confinement to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The ΝΟΑ team studying air pollution in urban areas has been surveying the common pollutant and greenhouse gas emission data and has found that a 30-50% car-use reduction by the majority of the population due to confinement measures has resulted in significant decreases of CO, NOx, PM and CO2 emissions by up to 40%. Also, due to stay-at-home orders (#menoumespiti), domestic heating is now used for longer hours with the heating profile of weekdays now resembling that of weekends. It was found that oil remains the predominant heating option in all regions of Greece, but differences between regions were observed as regards the second most used option. In Attica, use of air-conditioners is very common but in all other regions their use is roughly the same as biomass combustion.
• Monitoring of atmospheric permeability and visibility due to reduction of anthropogenic pollutants. The Institute for Environmental Research and Sustainable Development (IERSD) monitors on a continuous basis data directly related to particulate matter (aerosol) concentrations in the atmosphere from both anthropogenic (pollution) or natural (pollen, dust transfers) sources, as well as humidity levels. Initial results regarding visibility levels for the period 1/3/2020-10/4/2020 and their comparison with average values in multi-year visibility time series (for the same time of year and after subtracting rainy days) reveal a significant increase in atmospheric clarity and transparency. To cite just one example, visibility over 10 km has been observed 3.5 times more often than the expected average at this time of year.
• Study of the imprint of movement restriction measures on seismic background noise. The NOA Institute of Geodynamics (IG), in collaboration with the University of Patras, has launched a wide survey on seismic background noise, examining frequency data in the range of 5-25Hz from the 24-hour seismic activity recordings by the Hellenic Unified Seismological Network (HUSN) stations. Significantly, to this day observations reveal a noticeable gradual reduction in seismic background noise, which began immediately after the first announcement of confinement measures on March 13th, 2020 (shutdown of eating and drinking establishments, entertainment and recreational areas, malls, etc.), following closure of all schools and universities in the country on March 11th. Levels of seismic noise continued to decrease after the first announcement of measures, to ultimately record even lower values immediately after the second announcement imposing a general nation-wide lockdown as of March 23rd.
C. Experiments which are underway but have yet to yield results:
• Study of the possible influence of weather conditions on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The IERSD METEO Operational Unit has launched a large survey using machine-learning techniques to reveal and quantify possible correlations between epidemiological variables (number of confirmed cases and deaths) and meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, sunshine duration, etc.), taking also into account the impact of social distancing measures. The results will be used to measure the relative impact for each one of the examined meteorological variables on spread of COVID-19 disease.
• Monitoring of air pollution variation in the Attica Basin. In the context of monitoring the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic, the IERSD Atmospheric Physics and Chemistry Group (http://apcg.meteo.noa.gr/) monitors variation of air pollution in the Attica Basin, by conducting specialized measurements, at the NOA monitoring station in Thission, of common and specific pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (ΝΟ, ΝΟ2, ΝΟx), black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as well as of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in urban settings – a first for Greece. Furthermore, fluctuations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in major Greek cities are also monitored using data from the European Space Agency (ESA) new-generation Sentinel-5P satellite.
• Monitoring of atmospheric parameters by the NOA PANhellenic Geophysical observatory of Antikythera (PANGEA) to assess impact of COVID-19. The IERSD ground-based remote sensing team, in collaboration with European Research Infrastructure ACTRIS (Aerosol Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure), is participating in a pan-European project designed to collect atmospheric composition measurements, particularly regarding the vertical distribution of atmospheric parameters (aerosols, clouds, humidity), scheduled to take place from April 20 to the end of May 2020. The project aims at studying the influence of decreased anthropogenic activity (e.g. vehicle use, industrial activities, air flights). Measurements are collected at the novel NOA research infrastructure, the PANhellenic Geophysical observatory of Antikythera (PANGEA).

ATHENA RESEARCH AND INNOVATION CENTER IN INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND KNOWLEDGE TECHNOLOGIES
• Special version of BIP! Finder for COVID-19: BIP! Finder, available at (https://bip.imsi.athenarc.gr) is a tool that assists researchers in exploring available scientific literature. Its basic feature is that it supports ranking and comparing of scientific articles based on different impact scores. This enables researchers to prioritize searches based on their research interests, a particularly useful feature in an era characterized by extremely large numbers of publications available. The impact scores used are calculated through analysis of metadata for publications and their citation network. In the context of a wide awareness-raising effort to achieve a better understanding of issues related to COVID-19 and the coronavirus causing the disease, ATHENA RC developed a special version of the tool. 
• Organization of an online event on COVID-19: actions, tools, good practices and contact points in Greece. 
• Organization of an online conference by Research and Innovation Center “Athena” in the context of #APPOLONIS infrastructure under the title “Digital Humanities in the times of virus: a Twitter conference!”.

PATRAS SCIENCE PARK (PSP)
The PSP contribution consists in supporting the business sector by designing appropriate actions: 
• BIOPIX DNA TECHNOLOGY P.C.: A FORTH-spin-off company, BIOPIX manufactures innovative units for virus detection. The company was fully funded under the “Proof of Concept” program which is implemented by PSP exclusively from private donors.
• Application-driven Research& Innovative Engineering (ADRINE): PSP-hosted ADRINE start-up, launched by FORTH researchers Dr. P. Papas and Dr. G. Anagnostopoulos, specializes in rapid prototyping using 3D-printing.
• Aidplex: Aidplex start-up company fabricates new-generation splints which are waterproof, skin-friendly, recyclable and lightweight; recently, intensive collaboration with Project Veltio and “Covid-19 Response Greece” volunteering action has resulted in the creation of two different types of face shields, ready to be mass-produced, if required.

The HERACLES research group on the Exposome and Human Health of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Innovation, in collaboration with the University School of Advanced Studies IUSS in Pavia have developed a computational tool for the evaluation of the public health risk from the COVID-19 epidemic in Greece and Italy and evaluated the effectiveness of different non-pharmacological intervention scenarios for public health risk management. The computational tool for public health risk management from COVID-19 is called CORE: COVID Risk Evaluation model. It includes an advanced model of the spread of the epidemic and the final health risk assessment of the affected population. For more details see https://stiplab.github.io/Covid19/files/COVID-19%20Risk%20Evaluation%20model%20-%20CORE.pdf

Several research teams in Greek Universities (University of Thessaly, University of Thessaloniki) produce 3-D printing ventilators and/or protection material for COVID – 19, offered to local hospitals.  

","The current global crisis due to coronavirus will have a particularly negative impact both on the public research system and on the companies involved in research projects (mostly SMEs but also several large companies with R&D activities). Most R&D project funding in Greece is provided by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) through the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF). In particular, the beneficiary companies already face severe liquidity problems and will hardly comply with the requirements of the ESIF Regulations in order to receive the installments foreseen in the funding contracts. We believe that the risk of not implementing or not completing the research projects is particularly high and such a development would have disastrous consequences for the businesses themselves, but also for the absorption of the NSRF 2014-20 funds. Consequently, we plan to negotiate an extension of eligibility of expenses of the current programming period up to 2025.

At the administration level we are taking all possible measures to ameliorate the effects of restrictions and closures to our universities, research centres and enterprises. We, therefore, extended all deadlines for submission of proposals for R&I projects as well as those for interim monitoring and completion of running projects, upon request by the coordinators. At the same time we will make every effort to speed up the administrative steps and audits for interim / final reviews of projects and to allow / enable timely payments to the enterprises and research organizations that implement and complete their projects.

Ireland,2020-03-30 18:01:45.000,"Ireland’s Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Mark Ferguson, is participating in a research sub-committee of Ireland’s National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). There are plans to use this group as part of the assessment of the funding calls described elsewhere in this survey, so the projects funded are informed by national priorities and results will feedback into it.","Science Foundation Ireland's (SFI) C19 information portal is tracking relevant international Covid-19 STI responses in order to avoid duplication of effort.

SFI are the national contact point for Ireland on various international working groups, for example, OECD (High risk high gain research of the OECD's Global Science Forum), the Small Advanced Open Economies Initiative, Global Research Council Governing Board, the EU ELIXIR (ESFRI Research Infrastructure for life science data), and are coordinating efforts across these and various other channels.

SFI is in close contact with its international research funding partners such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the US to share information.

The Irish Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Mark Ferguson, shares information with international Chief Scientific Advisors, including that of the UK, Prof. Patrick Vallance. 

Prof. Ferguson’s role as chair of the European Innovation Council (EIC) will also support coordination of Covid-19 STI responses; the EIC has launched a call. 

","Science Foundation Ireland is not aware of a formal arrangement for this. We are communicating information from pre-agreed sources such as the Health Service Executive, Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and WHO.","Research and Innovation, in health, academia and industry, have a significant role to play in the national and global response to COVID-19. Consequently, the Government’s main research and innovation agencies have developed a coordinated Rapid Response Research and Innovation programme to help mitigate and manage the COVID-19 pandemic by unlocking the potential of Irish based researchers and innovators to join the global efforts. This coordinated response is comprised of two complementary strands. Having two focus areas allows for sufficient specialisation and coordination while optimising available resources.

(1) The first focus area targets Health services research; Patient-oriented and clinical research; and Population health research to COVID-19. This is led by the Heath Research Board (HRB) and the Irish Research Council (IRC) and details of the call can be found here: https://www.hrb.ie/funding/funding-schemes/all-funding-schemes/grant/covid-19-pandemic-rapid-response-funding-call-cov19-2020/

(2) The second focus area is an agile and adaptive initiative to combine the capabilities of industry and academia in the development of innovative solutions that can have a rapid demonstrable impact on the current COVID-19 crisis in Ireland, including but going beyond the health response to areas such as essential services and supply chains. This is led by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and details of the call can be found here: https://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/covid19-rapid-response/


","Several of the relevant agencies have initiatives in place to connect different actors. One part of Science Foundation Ireland’s (SFI's) 5 point plan for C19 is to connect the different stakeholders. The Health Innovation Hub Ireland has a portal in place to gather information and redirect actors to the right place. Furthermore:

• The two funding schemes mentioned in question 3 (i.e. the Rapid Response Research and Innovation programme) will bring together different STI actors. As part of the SFI, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland call, there is a call to action to come forward: (i) If you have identified a problem where you consider that RD&I could have impact and would like this problem to be highlighted to innovators and researchers, who may be able to advance a solution; and (ii) If you are currently working in an organisation (e.g. in industry, public service, research performing organisation etc.) on a solution that could generate significant impact and strengthen Ireland’s response to the current crisis, and you need to be connected with research experts, government departments or agencies in Ireland that may be able to assist. Here the funders will play a facilitation role in making the connections within Ireland to develop the solutions required. 

• SFI are also developing plans, using existing online platforms, to identify and curate the challenges where research can play a role in solving. These will then feedback into SFI’s existing activities e.g. the Funding Call.

• SFI have also developed a portal of information which will be used to facilitate and encourage collaborations across Ireland and internationally.

","There are no formal international level initiatives at the present time.

Science Foundation Ireland's C19 information portal is tracking relevant international Covid-19 STI responses in order to avoid duplication of effort, to identify areas where Ireland could join international efforts and / or implement similar responses to other countries that are needed in Ireland also.
","Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) expects some of these novel approaches to be deployed as a result of the two funding calls mentioned in question 3.

OECD Secretariat additions (30 March 2020):
CeADAR, Ireland’s National Centre for Applied Data Analytics and Machine Intelligence, is offering its AI expertise to help companies, government agencies, medical centres and research charities develop AI tools to help track the virus and monitor compliance of the general public. The centre can help organisations with large data sets to apply machine learning techniques.

","Science Foundation Ireland, the Health Research Board, and the Irish Research Council released a statement (https://www.sfi.ie/research-news/news/covid-19/) outlining the short-term approach to the STI system: a pragmatic approach will be taken which prioritises the safety and wellbeing of the research teams and the agency staff.

The IIA, Israel’s Ministry of Health, and the Ministry for Social Equality, through its Digital Israel initiative, announced on 24 March the allocation of NIS 50 million (approximately US $13 million) in grants for corona-fighting startups and companies. The grants will be allocated to companies submitting research and development plans, proofs-of-concept, products, and technological solutions that address the challenges of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.

In addition, the IIA, the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, and the Manufacturers Association of Israel are calling on industrial facilities and companies to submit R&D plans for the increased production of coronavirus-related products. As part of the initiative, the government will offer financial support of 50% to 75% of expenses to plans that will demonstrate the potential to bolster the country’s healthcare system or provide breakthroughs in the fight against coronavirus.

Italy,2020-03-29 14:09:16.000,"The head of the Civil Protection Department, Angelo Borrelli, established a scientific technical committee to deal with the Covid-19 emergency (Ordinance n. 630 of February 3, 2020). The Committee is composed of:
- Coordinator of the Office for the Promotion and Integration of the National Civil Protection Department, who will act as the coordinator of the scientific technical committee;
- Secretary General of the Ministry of Health;
- Director General of Health Prevention (Ministry of Health);
- Director of the Office for the Coordination of Maritime, Air and Border Health Offices of the Ministry of Health;
- Scientific Director of the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases; 
- President of the National Institute of Health;
- a member designated by the President of the Conference of Regions and Autonomous Provinces.

The Committee advises the Head of the Civil Protection Department on the adoption of the most appropriate prevention measures necessary to deal with the spread of Covid-19 (see http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/amministrazione-trasparente/provvedimenti/dettaglio/-/asset_publisher/default/content/ocdpc-n-630-del-3-febbraio-2020-primi-interventi-urgenti-di-protezione-civile-in-relazione-all-emergenza-relativa-al-rischio-sanitario-connesso-all-in).

","The complexity of the current Covid-19 pandemic crisis requires an exceptional effort by the international scientific community. On March 24, DG-RTD of the European Commission convened a meeting of the Research DGs of the 27 Member States for a first brainstorming on 
(i) priorities for EU coordinated R&I action on Covid-19 in the short (6 months) and medium term (12 months) and beyond; 
(ii) actions to be undertaken by Member States and the European Commission to best maximise funding (e.g. to complement and expand the already launched Covid-19 projects under Horizon2020); and
(iii) how to mobilise State long-term investors.

In this context, Italy proposes to establish a panel of high-level experts which could bridge and co-ordinate the scientific/public health domain with the wider societal domain (something similar to the ‘Mission Boards’), and would allow also scientific efforts and interactions with non-EU countries (e.g. USA, China, etc.) to be better co-ordinated. Furthermore, this ‘board’ could guarantee to have one strategy for COVID-19 (with standardized policies) across countries, also during the crucial post-quarantine phase, in order to ensure that the results obtained during the quarantine/isolation are not nullified.
","The strategy implemented in Italy to tackle the Covid-19 emergency involves an information campaign by the Ministry of Health and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, to make the measures adopted by the government clear to citizens. The daily press conference of the Civil Protection to update the national community on data about the pandemic is broadcast by all main TV networks. Furthermore, in order to reach the largest number of citizens, belonging to a range of different socio-demographic groups, the campaign is being promoted through the main social media networks (Facebook and Instagram), as well as on Italian television channels (private and public). In particular, citizens are warned against fake news. People are invited to rely upon official websites e.g. www.salute.gov.it/nuovocoronavirus.","The Government has kicked off the “Innova per l’Italia: la tecnologia, la ricerca e l’innovazione in campo contro l’emergenza Covid” project (https://innovazione.gov.it/innova-per-l-Italia-la-tecnologia-e-l-innovazione-in-campo-contro-l-emergenza-covid-19/), jointly managed by three Ministries (Innovation, Economic Development, University & Research) targeted at companies, universities, public and private research institutions, who can provide contributions in the field of development and production of devices for the prevention, diagnosis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2, to promote its containment. The project invites these actors to propose their contribution in three areas:
- the procurement, innovation or industrial re-conversion of their technologies and processes, to increase the availability of personal protective equipment (in particular surgical masks) and the production of complex respiratory systems for the treatment of respiratory syndromes (including individual components);
- the procurement of innovative kits or technologies to facilitate the diagnosis of Covid-19;
- technologies and tools for monitoring and prevention of Covid-19.
The proposals received will be evaluated and the Extraordinary Commissioner will activate the necessary steps to implement the approved projects.

The Italian Medicines Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) has also set up a crisis unit for the Covid-19 emergency (www.aifa.gov.it). Its strategy is based on four main areas of action: 
- promoting controlled clinical trials of off-label drugs;
- promoting R&D/access to experimental drugs;
- designing national guidelines for Covid-19 case management, in collaboration with the Civil Protection and Lazzaro Spallanzani Hospital;
- preventing shortage of drugs at the hospital level.

Italy strongly encourages exploitation of the ‘newborn’ European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) for sharing data and best practices according to an Open Science and Open Innovation approach. The GloPID-R project (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/874667) could represent another platform with a similar purpose. 
","See the response to question 3, where the “Innova per l’Italia: la tecnologia, la ricerca e l’innovazione in campo contro l’emergenza Covid” project (https://innovazione.gov.it/innova-per-l-Italia-la-tecnologia-e-l-innovazione-in-campo-contro-l-emergenza-covid-19/), jointly managed by three Ministries (Innovation, Economic Development, University & Research) is described.",See the response to question 1.,"A new project, lead by Italian industries, universities and research infrastructures, has been promoted and funded by the European Commission. The EXSCALATE4CoV (E4CoV) project aims to exploit the most powerful computing resources currently based in Europe to empower smart in-silico drug design, while increasing the accuracy and predictability of Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD). Advanced CADD, in combination with high-throughput biochemical and phenotypic screening, will allow the rapid evaluation of the results and reduce time for discovery of new drugs. E4CoV will select, through virtual screening protocols, the most promising drugs against SARS-Cov-2 from a pool of off-label drugs (> 10,000 drugs). At the same time, the Dompè Tangible Chemical Database (TCDb), comprising >500 billion molecules, will be screened to identify new potential drugs to be tested against Covid-19, thus enhancing the success rate of the virtual screening step. Other European participating institutions will contribute in the domains of bioinformatics (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, SIB), biochemical assays (Fraunhofer IME), phenotypic screenings (KU LEUVEN). Along with homology models, the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IIMCB) and Trieste Synchrotron will determine the crystal structure of the coronavirus functional proteins to further enhance the quality of the in-silico models and to evaluate the structural similarities with other viral proteins. The entire process will allow the rapid identification of active and safe molecules to be further tested in animal models and in clinical trials. The coupling of virtual screening with multiple high throughput biochemical and phenotypic screenings will allow the rapid identification of ‘safe in man’ off-label drugs for immediate treatment of the already infected population. Such massive virtual screening activities need a huge computational resource, therefore the activities will be supported and empowered by three of the most powerful computer centres in Europe, namely CINECA, BSC and JÜLICH. The supercomputing facilities have been extended to the other tier-0 systems in Europe, including the ENI Corporate HPC facility, and will be able to guarantee jointly the best combination of hardware architectures, the required knowledge, and the highest speed-up for the simulations. In addition, INFN (CERN Tier-1 centre) will make available their data sharing and high throughput infrastructure to facilitate products exploitation. The Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases is the eligible centre to test for the proof-of-concept in patients, and many others hospital and polyclinics in Italy and Europe confirmed their commitment to participate to this experimentation and project.","In the short term, we need to reflect on how to improve our foresight activities. Most OECD countries invested in these activities in the past, and designed their STI medium-to-long term initiatives accordingly, but we should recognise that our ability to anticipate troubles looming on the horizon was, at best, inadequate. 

Despite the scourge of SARS, MERS and EBOLA, just to mention the most recent viral disease outbreaks, in the last couple of decades we have been listening to a narrative that communicable diseases were as extinct as dinosaurs, but obviously they are not. Therefore, we should accordingly revise our vision and our priorities for investment.  

To guarantee preparedness worldwide - because we know that there will be other epidemics, but we do not know where they can break out again in the future - we should encourage and incentivise seamless sharing data and best practices worldwide. Italy sees this as one of the priorities for the European Open Science Cloud which is now entering into operation.

Furthermore, we should make use of smart directionality, based on scientific evidence and, hence, on research, in orientating the evolution of our health systems. This evolution, in the recent past, has been characterised by a trend which led to a reduction of hospitalizations per inhabitant on one hand, and, on the other hand, to strengthening large care centres. This concentration process, providing greater quality, competence and cutting-edge technologies, should have been accompanied, in principle, by an enhancement of primary care, to ensure overall care services as close as possible to the citizen. In reality, especially in the case of complex care pathways, and the Covid-19 is a case in point, a significant communication and coordination gap remains between these two settings of care, which can cause, and indeed has caused in the current epidemic, a harmful delay in the early detection of cases, which is crucial for circumscribing a sprouting epidemic. 

In this complex challenge of combining the need to guarantee proximity of the services to the patient and the excellence of the healthcare, a fundamental role can be played by new technologies, that can allow these two perspectives to be reconciled, to improve and simplify the processes of diagnosis and care and, in short, to bring excellence to the patients’ home. 

Therefore, besides the ordinary instruments of the current and future R&I programmes, a step forward would be a ‘one stop shop’, to be co-funded by a multilateral initiative (see e.g. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), with an open-ended list of topics, among which a place should be reserved to the development of technologies aimed at supporting preparedness and resilience of our health systems and increasing social cohesion, through a strong person-centric, smart primary health care.

MEXT has permitted the flexible use of funds for the support of researchers' overseas travel, and has been working to ensure that research exchanges will be promoted as usual after the situation is improved.
In the medium- and long-term, it is expected that private investment for R&D will decrease due to economic recession. Additionally, the needs of providing scientific evidence in order to adequately respond to infectious diseases and the importance of further deepening international cooperation for addressing infectious diseases will grow.

An online forum was also held by the Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies, Korean Academy of Science and Technology and the National Research Council of Science & Technology. ","- Korea participated in the weekly ministerial conference call meetings (on March 11, 18 and 25) on STI response for COVID-19, organized by the Office of Science and Technology (OSTP) of the U.S in which 11 to 14 countries participated, and discussed international cooperation measures (e.g. use AI to extract relevant information from open data, measures to share COVID-19 data and research outcomes). 
- During the bilateral ministerial call meeting between Korea and US held on March 6 Korea shared the benchmarking cases of Korea, such as the use of Drive-Thru and Self-diagnosis App and sought ways to cooperate in various fields such as diagnostic technology and vaccine development ","- Korea shares the latest available scientific information in a prompt and transparent manner through official website(ncov.mohw.go.kr) as stipulated in domestic law (Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act) which establishes the public’s right to be informed about the latest developments of and responses to outbreaks and infection control. Korea also mandates the disclosure of the whereabouts, means of transportation, healthcare institutions visited, and contacts of confirmed Covid-19 cases.
- Korea shares the latest information (the number of patients, the number of those of under isolation, the number of diagnostic tests, whereabouts of confirmed cases, etc.) and relevant measures via regular briefing that take place twice a day (by the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters in the morning and the Central Disease Control Headquarters in the afternoon) and the frequent distribution of press release, as well as via websites, SNS channels, and portal sites.
- Korea is also promoting the code of conduct for infection prevention. For example, Korea is distributing customized promotional materials for daycare centers, schools, healthcare institutions, pharmacies, etc., and delivering information through a range of easily accessible media (TV, radio, trains, buses, YouTube channels, etc.). Also, Korea is offering counselling for and receiving reports from the public and healthcare institutions through public health centers and the KCDC call center (☎1339) (15,908 call cases out of 16,557(96.1%) & 483 health care out of 485 (99.9%) handled as of March 25).
- Korea is stringently responding to fake news, which leads to excessive public anxiety and causes confusion in infection control, through the pan-governmental cooperation system that encompasses Korea Communications Commission, the National Police Agency, and the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.
- Regarding COVID-19 media coverage, an expert group is providing review comments and global trend reports.
- The Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology(KRIBB) has opened a portal (http://kobic.re.kr/COVID19) to quickly collect and provide research data and information related to COVID-19 from around the world.
- The Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies, National Academy of Medicine of Korea and the National Research Council of Science & Technology jointly organized an online forum to fact check COVID-19 information on March 12.","- Korea is actively carrying out public-private clinical studies on COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. Korea undertook studies on testing kits, treatment, epidemiological study and vaccine development since February 2020.
- The MSIT supported private companies’ development of COVID-19 testing kits to make rapid testing available as soon as possible. Three of the five companies that developed COVID-19 testing kits received support from the MSIT.
- The MSIT is also supporting the Institute Pasteur Korea and Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology to find a treatment for COVID-19 through repurposing drugs whose safety is verified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
- To help Korean COVID-19 testing companies secure technological competitiveness, the MSIT has formed a research council on medical devices for infectious diseases with government-funded research institutes and hospitals specializing in infectious diseases and medical devices, and is providing necessary technology, equipment and networks.","- The central government is cooperating with local governments to respond to COVID-19 effectively. The Central Disaster Management Headquarters (led by the KCDC director) is responsible for all disease control activities, while the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters (led by the prime minister) is providing a swift government-wide support. As for local governments, the Local Disaster Management Headquarters (managed by local government heads) is taking all infection prevention measures available for COVID-19 response.
- Korea formed a COVID-19 response consultative body (composed of Korean Medical Association, Korean Hospital Association, Korea Dentist Association, Association of Korean Medicine, Korean Nurses Association and Korea Pharmaceutical Association) to share COVID-19 response situations and how the medical and pharmaceutical circles should cooperate and exchange opinions on the medical response in the field.","- Korea is participating in international COVID-19 response by inviting foreign researchers to Korean COVID-19 research projects or joining in international cooperative research projects on COVID-19.
- For example, a clinical research team from the WHO is going to participate in the cohort research led by Korean doctors on the virus’ cycle (infection-exacerbation-recovery).
- The International Vaccine Institute, located in Korea, formed an industry-academia-research institution consortium with Korean universities and biotech companies to develop a DNA vaccine for COVID-19 (GX-19).","-To contain COVID-19 outbreaks, the Korean government has established a support system for quarantine and epidemiological study using big data and ICT. As this system uses smart city technologies, which collect and process large-scale city data, the government can quickly identify and track the locations of confirmed and suspect cases to curb the spread of the virus.
- When MERS-CoV spread in Korea in 2015, Korea amended its Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act to allow using data exceptionally to control and prevent the spread of infectious disease while protecting privacy.  In response to COVID-19, using cloud platforms to collect and analyse data, Korea has efficiently shared information with the KCDC, local governments, telecommunications companies and credit card companies to establish a faster epidemiological investigation system.
- To contain the spread of the virus, Korea supported the development of applications that allow citizens to self-diagnose and civil servants to monitor the health status and locations of citizens who are under self-quarantine.
- Korea has effectively released a limited amount of public masks to prevent the spread of infection among citizens, and shared public information about the public masks in cooperation with private companies to solve purchase inconveniences and concerns. As a result of cooperation with private companies, the relevant application and web service were developed quickly.
- To support small and medium-sized enterprises in teleworking, Korea provides SMEs with subsidies for cloud service fees (2.5 billion KRW) and a smart work pilot project (300 million KRW), while providing free or discounted teleworking-related services by partnering with major Korean software companies.
- In response to the increasing necessity for distance learning following the spread of COVID-19, Korea provided free, zero-rating-based online education to low and middle income students in cooperation with three major telecommunications companies.
- Besides, various AI and data companies in Korea are actively participating to overcome the COVID-19 crisis. Representatively, companies provide GIS-based comprehensive situation map services to provide information on the spread of infection and response information. In addition, by providing AI voice-bot service, it is possible to check the health status of people showing symptoms or those who have contacted infected persons. Also, the companies provide trend information through media traffic data analysis. In addition, cloud companies are carrying out various supports to help small and medium-sized enterprises overcome the COVID-19 crisis, including support for developing COVID-19 related applications, web services, and telecommuting solutions. Healthcare companies such as Seegene, Vuno and JLK Inspection utilize AI technologies to drastically reduce the time for developing diagnostics kits and reading X-ray images. Other companies including Deargen and Arontier use AI technologies in screening for drug repositioning and identifying candidate materials for new drug, which would dramatically reduce the time for developing therapeutics. ","- In the short run, R&D budget for infectious diseases will increase; in the middle to long term, international cooperation for infectious disease response will be strengthened (e.g. sharing of information about infectious disease symptoms, global platform for virus data, joint development of vaccines and treatments, global disease prevention and control system, etc.)
- Korea is implementing measures to reorganize STI system for infectious diseases and periodically check the system, and plans to establish a virus research institute that comprehensively studies viruses to systematically respond to infectious diseases.","In order to recover from the economic damage caused by COVID-19, Korea has established an additional budget of 11.73 trillion KRW, of which 71.5 billion KRW has been budgeted for R&D. Considering the existing emergency response research, the total amount for COVID-19 related R&D is 10.9 billion KRW. Emergency response research is tasked to respond to various unexpected disaster and safety problems. These COVID-19 emergency response research includes rapid diagnosis, re-creation of therapeutics, analysis of unique characteristics of COVID-19, and acquisition of research resources and prediction of spread.","Instead of travel bans or lockdown measures, Korea has actively tested asymptotic and suspected cases to mitigate COVID-19 outbreaks. What made Korea’s approach successful is regulatory flexibility that allowed innovative measures such as emergency approval (limited but prompt approval of production, sale and use of testing kits) and Drive-Thru testing."

Mexico,2020-03-29 21:48:34.000,Federal government is in constant communication with experts during this international health crisis. They consult directly with doctors and specialists in epidemiology to foresee the advances of the epidemic and the increase in cases across the country to reduce the spread of the disease. ,"The National Council for Science and Technology is working constantly on keeping abreast on the international response to the Covid-19 crisis, including research on the new spread of cures and trials for vaccines. At local level, several efforts are being made with research centres to test those efforts and be prepared for the worst phase of the epidemic. ","Yes, the federal government is informing citizens people every day and several times a day. Information based in facts and statistics are shared about the advances of the epidemic and efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Most of the messages are being led by the Ministry of Health. Others are led by the foreign service. Security is also involved in regards of the guidelines to follow in terms of the quarantine and the potential of any danger for the general public. ","The president has set aside a vast amount of resources to be prepared for the contingency. Several measures to be implemented by the Ministry of Health, specially regarding equipment for people infected and for health personnel. Other resources are being poured on R&D trough National Council for Science and Technology to ensure that proper research is being conducted on new treatment, potential cure and vaccination. All takes into account the information received from experts in the country. ",Different ministries such as the Science and Technology Council engage in efforts to learn about the potential cure or vaccine for the virus and find out how different countries are fighting the disease and caring for the sick. The health ministry is constantly updating about the advances of the disease and the new cases. Researchers and technical experts are finding new ways to fight the disease. A company that was born at a research center is proving services to allow test to be performed more promptly and at lower cost.  ,"There are many countries where private individuals offer aid to alleviate the crisis. There plenty of trials that involve two or more countries to test new medicine and new ways of treatment. Researchers worldwide are working along with health companies to test new and old treatments such as interferon, hydroxcloroquine, and else. A trial in Seattle involving volunteers that had the virus was receiving aid and input from researchers across different countries. ",There are efforts being made using cutting edge technology to e.g. create equipment at low cost using 3D printing and other company is providing services to analize samples at low cost and much less time to speed the process using DNA-based diagnoses. ,The national Council for Science and Technology is planning to provide resources on specific research for the disease. In the short term we might see a decrease in activity first for the obligated quarantine but mostly because lack of resources that might need to be directed on patient care. CONACYT is working on a long term plan on how to get more information from researchers and act on them. The objective is to implement National Innovation Plan in the medium term. ,"Yes, the government is aware of the importance on research of STI. Consequently, the National Council for Science and Technology is tasked to prepare an agenda on the research plan for the next years.

Netherlands,2020-04-01 08:30:40.000,"The Dutch RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) is in close contact with the government and part of the Outbreak Management Team. 

The National Crisis Decision-making Manual outlines the powers, responsibilities and core tasks of the main actors within the national crisis structure. This core of this structure consists of the Interdepartmental and the Ministerial Crisis Management Committee:

The Commission, chaired by the Minister of Justice and Security or the Prime Minister, decides (by majority) on all measures and arrangements for a coherent approach in a situation where national security is at stake or in another situation that has or can have a major impact on society

Interdepartmental Crisis Management Committee (ICCb)
This High Official Level Commission (DG) is chaired by the NCTV and advises the MCCb and takes its own decisions if necessary and possible.

Flexible
Experts can attend ICCb and MCCb on invitation. Examples include experts in a specific field or representatives of other governments, government services or (vital) sectors. ICCb and MCCb are supported and advised by an Interdepartmental Coordination Consultation and a multidisciplinary staff that are deployed as needed and are flexibly arranged and composed, for example for the provision of information, image and judgment, advice on specific aspects, crisis communication or parliamentary accountability. ","On an economic field, the responses are coördinated within the EU: the EU takes action with an economic response. ","The Dutch public broadcasting foundation regularly asks experts to tell about COVID-19. Expert information, both from the WHO and scientists, is regularly referred to in newspapers and commercial broadcasting foundations. There seems to be only a small minority of newsmakers busy with misleading information. 
However, it's hard to tell what voices are there below the surface. There is some news about false information, ranging from conspiracy theories to misleading health advice. ","1. A guarantee facility for SME loans (BMKB) is already in place and working – EUR 665 million of an available budget of EUR 765 million, 0.08% of GDP. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has expanded guarantees to a higher guarantee percentage, up to 90% of the credit risk of banks for SMEs that want to take out a loan of EUR 1.5 mln maximum but that do not have the required collateral. This measure was recently expanded for SMEs coping with risks associated with the nitrogen ruling (adopted) and is further expanded to apply to SMEs affected by COVID-19.
2. Businesses can request for a special deferral of payment in income tax, corporate tax, turnover tax, energy tax and wage tax. Temporarily, no penalties for failure to pay taxes (on time) will be imposed. Businesses that already forecast lower profits due to the epidemic can request a reduction of the provisional tax assessment and will be able to pay less initial tax in order to avoid liquidity problems. To avoid immediate liquidity problems, the requirement for a “third expert” will not have to be included in the request immediately (but after two weeks). Moreover, the tax authorities will temporarily decrease the recovery interest rate from 4% to 0.01%. 
5. The so-called GO-regulation, through which SMEs can secure a 50% guarantee from the government on their bank loans and bank guarantees, will be expanded. The maximum ceiling guaranteed will be increased from EUR 400 million tot EUR 1.5 billion and the maximum GO-facility per firm will be increased from EUR 50 million to EUR 150 million. This will enable both small and large  firms to benefit from this policy.
6. In order to support small firms and start-ups with little financial reserves, we will expand the Qredits-programme. Through this program, we expect to support approximately 3000 to 6000 firms by a deferment of payment for a period of a maximum of six months and by giving those firms a discount on their rent payments for the same period. 
7. Agricultural and horticultural SMEs will be supported by temporarily relaxing the guarantee for working capital, which is part of the existing decree Borgstelling MKB-Landbouwkredieten (BL). The decree will ease acute liquidity problems for agricultural and horticultural business who experience those problems due to the COVID-situation. The credit is for a maximum of 2 years.
8. Repayments of Innovation Credit and Early Stage Financing, both subsidies in the form of a credit, can be delayed for six monthts. 
9. Likely, the Dutch Health ministry will do additional investments, together with the science and the economic departments, for Corona-related medicines. 
","Within the topsector policy, different stakeholders are already involved. They thus have a platform to find solutions to Covid-19 and already have applied EUR 5 million. Furthermore, they are making Covid-19 related data publicly available. ","On an European level, Horizon 2020 has also been rescheduled to find COVID-19 related vaccines and medicines. ","As far as today, there are no new initiatives . However, TNO, which is a multidiscliplinary applied research institute, has already started doing extra research, focussed on crisis management tools and medical instruments. ","It is hard to forecast the eventual consequences. On the short run, there are already a few results: 
- less R&D teaken place (best guess, no official data yet, however already firms indicating).
- Clinical trials are harder to do;
- Firms, especially young firms, find it harder to attract venture capital. 
On the longer run, firms might start to do more R&D, as they can put their attention in R&D rather than operational activities. This has been a result of the 2008 financial crisis. It is hard to tell if these results also are valid for this crisis.  
","The stimulus package is aimed primarily at sectors in the economy targeted most - hotels, restaurants, café's, and other freelancers who are no longer able to do their work. Given that it is hard for some young entrepreneurs - especially young innovative start-ups - to show the 'economic damage' done by them. It is currently being debated how and if they can be helped.

","1. Measures that have been implemented
The Norwegian Research Council (RCN) has launched a COVID-19 Emergency Call for funding in order to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The aim is to support research that will enable us to understand and contain the new COVID-19, as well as to improve efficient patient management and public health (national and international) preparedness and response to the current and analogous outbreaks that may come in the future. The call for proposals is based on the recent research priorities defined by the WHO. International collaboration with research groups in other countries, including those funded by GLOPID-R member organisations to foster larger-scale studies, is encouraged. The scope of the proposals may include different topics, including health and economic aspects. The total budget is EUR 2 560 000.

In cooperation with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The RCN is also launching several extraordinary measures in order to strenghten COVID-19 research in and in cooperation with lower income countries. A call for proposals on global health with a 20 May deadline has been allocated an additional 20 million NOK for projects of particular relevance to Covid-19.

The Research Council also has a large portfolio of ongoing projects on issues in the fields of health, biotechnology and societal issues that may be relevant for COVID-19 as well. In addition, several research institutions and public health authorities (such as the Norwegian Institute of Public Health) conduct research that is relevant for this issue. However, we do not have a complete overview or a list of projects. 

2. Measures under consideration, not yet decided 

The suggested measures encompass the Research Council's project portfolio as well as the different research-performing sectors, particularly related to trade and industry and the institute sector (the independent research institutes). The measures will be discussed with the relevant ministries.

The measures suggested by the Research Council have been divided into six categories: 
1. General measure aimed toward the institute sector (increased basic funding) 
2. General measures aimed toward trade and industry 
3. Measures aimed toward the direct restructuring of businesses 
4. Digitalisation measures and competence-building for digitalisation (""kompetanseløft for digitalisering"")
5. Measures aimed toward real-time research and research for crisis management
6. Other measures (the Norwegian public sector, the consequences for low-income countries) 
In addition to these suggested measures, the Research Council wishes to implement measures related to:
-  funding percentage;
-  the research organisations' own contributions for projects that receive funding; 
- changes to the contract period and other changes to the contract that can in part be carried out within the current funding and partly through increased public funding in order to reduce risk, as well as facilitate the situation for the most vulnerable actors in trade and industry and the institute sector.
 
Furthermore, there is a need for measures aimed toward improving the situation for young researchers (PhD candidates and Postdoctoral fellows) who must stay at home to care for children, thereby being barred from using laboratories and other research infrastructure.

Most of the measures are time-limited, and the budget for the majority of the measures must be distributed across several years as this concerns multiannual centres or research projects.
","In order to ensure national coordination, the Central Norway Regional Health Authority has been tasked with coordinating research in the hospital sector. Including harmonisation of protocols and facilitating recruitment from smaller hospitals. An overview of ongoing research is available at www.norcrin.no/nasjonal-oversikt-over-covid-19-studier/ 

Under the auspices of the various ministries and the Research Council of Norway there is substantial interaction and meetings between STI actors (universities, the research institute sector, industry, government, health sector) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19. ","The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is a foundation that takes donations from public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations, to finance independent research projects to develop vaccines against emerging infectious disease (EID). CEPI is headquartered in Oslo, Norway. At the 2017 launch, Nature said, ""It is by far the largest vaccine development initiative ever against viruses that are potential epidemic threats"". In March 2020, CEPI was identified as a ""key player in the race to develop a vaccine"" for the coronavirus. 

Norway had originally allocated 1,6 billion NOK to CEPI for the years 2017-2025, but has now allocate an additional 2,2 billions given the acute circumstances. 

In order to find out whether some of the existing medications may work against Covid-19, the WHO recently launched a global megatrial called SOLIDARITY. The coordinator of the is study John-Arne Røttingen, Chief Executive of the Research Council of Norway. According to a WHO press briefing on April 1st, 74 countries have so far joined the study, and more than 200 patients have been enrolled. ",,"The higher education sector, the business sector, the institute sector and other stake holders with different backgrounds, are working strategically to find innovative solutions for communication and cooperation. This new insight will in time change the way we interact.  
","Additional responses have been new funding from the Ministries of Fisheries and Industry and Oil and Energy to increase the level of support to innovation projects that have recently been initiated. This concerns several hundred companies across the country and across sectors. Further, a call for proposals has been published for business innovation projects. 

Some redistribution of funds will be carried out, notably to better support research on economic consequences of the Corona crisis and the health industry. Further redistribution of existing funds is expected.

To better adapt to current circumstances, standard deadlines have been abolished so that companies can apply on a continuous basis. The state aid rules will be more effectively applied, and funding decisions will be done throughout 2020. This also implies a significant renewal of internal procedures in the Research Council of Norway to accommodate larger funding streams and a need for efficiency. Previously agreed timelines for projects may be adapted, allowing for delays or speeding up as appropriate. Requirements for cash contributions may be abandoned to adapt to the tight liquidity situation experienced by many companies.

Upon request from The Ministry of Higher Education and Research, the Research Council of Norway has proposed measures to alleviate the negative consequences for industry and society. This includes a range measures in support of the STI system. The suggested measures are currently being reviewed. ",

- A platform to mobilize researchers - SCIENCE 4 COVID19 – to contribute to responses to the crisis is also being set up. “Science 4 COVID19”: is an open and inclusive call for ideas and the organization of task forces to collect and mobilize ideas from science and innovation players, with a website under preparation by the Portuguese Science Foundation, FCT and the Agency for Clinical Research and Biomedical Innovation, AICIB, in close cooperation with public and private research institutions.
- Higher education and research institutions are also mobilizing efforts to respond to the emergency, both by providing expert knowledge and developing research solutions, as well as, mainly in the biomedical area, gathering and donating equipment and support materials to hospitals and health units. Several HEIs have promoted dedicated sites to gather additional external support. One Associate Laboratory, the Institute for Molecular Medicine (IMM) has already developed an autonomous coronavirus test, which has been recently approved and will contribute to enhance the existing capacity to test infections. Other research institutes are also developing autonomous testing procedures. A fast screening kit and system has been developed by the firm Biosurfit (https://www.biosurfit.com/en/) with tests in a Hospital in Lisbon;
- The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation has set up an Emergency Fund Covid-19 – is a Fund created by Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 5 million Euros initial funding, aiming at strengthening the society resilience to the pandemic in 5 main areas: Health, Science, Civil Society, Education and Culture.  Funding lines considering in the STI area: to tackle the shortage of protection devices and medical equipment, to support early detection and diagnosis, technology based solutions (as platforms and apps), reinforcement of scientific knowledge on 2019 - Covid-19 (vulnerable groups and risk factors, immunity response to the virus, new treatment strategies, new diagnosis methods, involving Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, IGC); support people in need to access distance learning while schools are closed; Bolsas Mais (fellowships for students with less resources applying to university).","The Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education, organized − in the scope of the Portugal in Europe Research and Innovation Network- PERIN − through the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation, FCT, the National Agency for Clinical Research and Biomedical Innovation, AICIB, and the National Innovation Agency, ANI – a Task Force on  “Research and innovation for preventing Corona virus in Europe”   to give notice of the Portuguese actions and positions for potential enlarged EU joint ventures, which will gain from an enlarged European task force, for articulation of methodologies and, above all, validation/certification of analysis and the communication of results  for population at large. Initiatives which are being sought to be promoted and developed at international/European level include:
- Need to develop Equipment and Devices: namely Testing kits (PCR and other methodologies), which require enlarging supply of materials and reagents at an European level; Fast development of ventilators for emergency rooms, which require specific valves and other components, available only in a few companies, as well as the adoption of protocols for safe operation (there is the need of coordination of several task forces in Europe beyond actions under the Open AIR project); Other innovative equipment, systems, solutions and devices, which require promoting European joint tasks for innovative products and systems able to generate low cost solutions to prevent the contamination of the virus and COVID-10.
- Data systems and policy: COVID-19 information systems for population, with open data policy integrated with data analysis to provide orientations towards advising population at large for prevention measures, as well as to prevent false alarms. This initiative requires access to health data and information of tests of population at large as well as the mobilization of data scientists, and which will gain from an enlarged European task force, for articulation of methodologies and, above all, validation/certification of analysis and the communication of results for population at large.
- New solutions/interventions: Coordination of national task forces to foster user-driven innovation and new science-based solutions, which will gain from an enlarged European task force.
- Vaccine/new therapies: Need for a major European task force and cooperation to help developing a vaccine and other potential therapies, with major Portuguese biochemical firms working already with international consortia, with tests in China and elsewhere.
- Science and society - Social remediation and promotion of social and human actions to foster social resilience: There is a need of European coordination of a task force on risk perception and the development of actions towards the promotion of scientific culture and social engagement towards resilient societies.
- Distance education and telework: The sudden strong development and engagement by all higher education institutions in Portugal, with a massive adoption of distance education schemes, highlights the need of European coordination of task force to foster the exchange of schemes, methodologies and practices.
There has been an active promotion and support to the Portuguese participation in the recent EC call of proposals on health and COVID-19 related topics for SMEs, by AICIB – National Agency for Clinical Research and Biomedical Innovation and the National Innovation Agency, ANI.
Portugal is also participating in a wider 'Task Force' at EU level, with DG RTD, which has namely contributed to launch a funding line of 47,5 M€ on a new call on “SC1-PHECORONAVIRUS-2020: Advancing knowledge for the clinical and public health response to the [COVID-19] epidemic”.","- A research call has been launched, on March 27, in the context of the National Initiative for Digital Competences (INCoDe.2030) – AI 4 COVID-19 – Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in Public Administration to strengthen the fight to COVID-19 and future pandemias. These projects require the partnership of research institutes with public administration entities, and must be in line with the National Plan for the Preparation and Response to the Disease by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from the Directorate-General for Health (DGS). The projects are expected to focus on big data, analytic techniques and models, computational resources and products and results implementing novel research approaches in the context of public administration entities.
- Portugal has joined other countries in claiming open access to publications and data on the COVID-19. A broad set of high level officials responsible for science and technology policies at the global level, including the Portuguese Minister of Science and Technology and Higher Education, issued a Declaration pledging for the main scientific societies to make available, promptly and voluntarily, all publications and data as regards the new corona virus, which triggered the COVID-19 pandemics,  either in public repositories and in digital format.
- A tentative task for COVID-19 information systems for population, with open data policy integrated with data analysis to provide orientations towards advising population at large for prevention measures, as well as to prevent false alarms is being set up by the Portuguese Science Foundation, FCT, in cooperation with health authorities and under the overall coordination of the Public Health Scholl of the University of Porto, under the National Digital Skills Initiative, INCoDe.2030.","Introducing changes in funding rules/conditions and procedures to speed up processes and streamline bureaucratic procedures;
Streamlining the launch of European, regional and national calls for tenders/research proposals, in order to significantly diminish the Time-To-Grant; 
Intensification of transnational cooperation as sharing knowledge and information on needs and capacity will contribute to a more efficient protection of infected citizens and contagion limitation.
","A wide set of measures have been announced in response to the expect slump of the economy and ensuing recession. The novel characteristics of the current crisis, that is almost stopping the whole economy, is, nevertheless, hitting different economic sectors with different degrees. Some thriving sectors in Portugal, such as tourism and restaurants, have come to a sudden standstill, while others have been able to maintain a certain level of economic activity. The initial package of measures, beyond the strictly public health measures, have focused on providing financial support to business firms, through a variety of measures, including some directed to the most hit sectors mentioned above, as well as measures aimed to support employment, workers and families. While measures have not been aimed specifically at the STI system, beyond those referred to above, aimed at supporting STI system's contribution to the response to the COVID-19 crisis, the ongoing process of linking of SMEs, start-ups and the research system with larger corporations in broader collaborative initiatives, promoting open innovation and new spaces of co-creation in order to build stronger knowledge and distributed innovation, is expected to have impacts on the economy and on the STI systems beyond the short-term. Additional measures are expected to be developed throughout the response to the crisis and its different stages.

5. Ammendments to the legislation prohibiting the distibution of misleading information about Covid-19 and suggesting substantial fines for organisations and individuals disseminating false information.","Since 13 March, 2020 the following policy measures related to STI are being implemented:

1. Allocation of additional budgetary funding (1.5 billion roubles) for the development of means of prevention and diagnosis of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-2019).
2. Allocation of additional budgetary funding for the domestic production of artificial respirating units (Source: https://xn--80aesfpebagmfblc0a.xn--p1ai/ai/html/3/attach/2020-03-26_coronavirus_government_report.pdf).
3. Since March 16, all Russian universities were recommended to introduce mixed and distance learning formats. To support universities during the transition period in connection with the unfavorable situation caused by the new coronavirus infection (COVID-2019), a Situation Center of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science and a hotline have been created. The recommendations for the universities on the transfer of educational courses to the online format were developed by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education.
4. The procedure for registration of medical devices for the diagnosis of coronavirus infection has been accelerated (https://www.rosminzdrav.ru/news/2020/03/26/13595-minzdrav-rossii-protsedura-registratsii-medizdeliy-dlya-diagnostiki-koronavirusnoy-infektsii-maksimalno-uskorena).

The research of Russian scientists has been recently published regarding ""Artificial intelligence for the repurposing of approved or investigational drugs against COVID-19"" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339998830_AI_for_the_repurposing_of_approved_or_investigational_drugs_against_COVID-19

Compex ICT systems are being implemented to track locations of COVID-19 cases to control the spreading of the disease.

Some universities and commercial teaching centres are opening their online courses for wider audience free of charge.


","It is difficult to anticipate the impact of COVID-19 crisis on the Russian STI system especially in the medium- and long-term. In the short-term one might expect targeted support of focused research devoted to the development of drugs against the coronovirus infection, as well as the development of new means for testing the COVID-19. Considering the expected slowdown in the global economy, gross R&D expenditures may decrease in the mid-term, especially those performed by the business enterprise sector. On the other hand, we may expect a further increase in the digitalisation of science and the economy as a whole, as well as strengthening of the role of the state. In the mid-term, a revision of STI policy priorities and certain growth of innovation activity (as a result of the search for the opportunities to meet the demand in new economic conditions) might take place. In the long-term, there is a possibility for the development of autonomous production technologies (within the framework of general partial reindustrialisation) and for the robotisation in the service sector.","Policy measures to support SMEs and entrepreneurs have been introduced by the President of Russia on 25 March, 2020:
- SMEs are granted a deferral of all taxes, except VAT, for six months. Micro-enterprises will be given a deferment of insurance payments.
- The size of insurance payments for employees of SMEs should be reduced from 30% to 15% (this will not affect salaries at or below the minimum wage).
- Loans to individual entrepreneurs will be prolonged.
- SMEs affected by the crisis should receive a loan extension of six months.
- A six-month moratorium on filing bankruptcy claims by companies and collecting debts and fines.

South Africa,2020-03-29 15:34:22.000,"The South African Department of Health coordinates national response to COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn engages through Cabinet’s National Command Council for decision-making and coordinating the management of interventions by various institutions and individuals. 

The scientific advice to government take many forms. However, there are two most noticeable ones.  Namely, it goes through formal channels such as the Health Ministerial Advisory Committee whose research subcommittee is chaired by the President of the Medical Research Council. Advice is sought and offered daily. Second, there is a COVID 19 Research and Innovation Group, which is focusing on the scaling up of testing, surveillance and clinical research.   
Given that COVID-19 is not just a public health matter, it has implications on water, human settlements, economy, employment, agriculture and equality. In this regard, various Science Councils, the Academy of Science of South Africa and the National Advisory Council on Innovation and higher education institutions and individual experts continue to provide scientific advice proactively or at the behest of government.  
South African society is highly engaged.  In this regard, public statements and articles are being published in various media platforms (including conventional media [television, radio, print] and social networks) to inform and help to shape the current and future response to the pandemic.
","The Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) is engaging with international partners at bilateral and multilateral level to establish links and possible partnerships for rapid responses to the pandemic. These engagements include the following:
• The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
South  Africa  will participate in the Virtual Ministerial Dialogue on the role of international cooperation in science and Open Science to combat Covid-19 due to take place on 30 March 2020..  

• African Union (AU) Commission 
South Africa is exploring collaboration with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) to support the operationalization of the African CDC platforms for clearing and sharing research results and scientific information on the fight against the virus. Virtual discussions on the platform among eminent scientists can also contribute to the identification of knowledge gap on the virus that can lead to research topic that network of African researchers can embark on research issues.

• The Southern African Development Community (SADC)
South Africa is exploring to harness the capability of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) Flagships, namely the Southern African Network for Bioscience (SANBIO) and the Southern African Network for Water Centres of Excellence (SANWATCE) to respond to COVID-19.

• International Science Council (ISC)
South  Africa will further support the African Open Science Platform (AOSP) to enable open access and data sharing in support of the fight against COVID-19.

• European Union (EU)
South Africa is planning to join a call for proposals to be issued by the European Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP), by adding funding to enable South African participants to develop Southern African regional networks.  The call will cover topics such as: understanding the history of the infection; improving surveillance capabilities; developing point-of-care diagnostic tests; supporting clinical management of clinical trials for diagnostics and therapeutics; and validation and adoption of serological tests.

• China
Extensive bilateral research and innovation cooperation is being explored.
","• The South African Government has published regulations under the Disaster Management Act 2002 specifically dealing with “fake news” and Covid-19. Under section 11(5) of the regulations, it becomes an offence to publish a statement through any medium with the intention to deceive about Covid-19, anyone’s Covid-19 infection status or government measures to address the pandemic. The penalty is a fine or imprisonment for six months, or both.
• The Department of Health, supported by the entire government communications machinery, has led efforts to raise awareness among the general public around screening and detection, prevention, hygiene control and the importance of social distancing.
• Also, the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) in collaboration with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), embarked on an Immediate public survey via social media to understand SA public's knowledge about COVID-19, how prepared people are to care for themselves and for other and how they feel about it. The purpose is to identify the attitudes and behaviours of key informant groups, i) taxi drivers, ii) religious leaders, iii) traditional leaders, iv) homes for elderly, v) informal tavern owners, vi) CEO's of private companies, vii) health care workers, viii) Medical aid schemes. This will be follow-up with qualitative research.
","• As a first step, the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) has redirected R4 million (€219,000) from some of its projects to research on COVID-19. The Department is supporting local research that will focus on surveillance, therapeutics and understanding the local epidemiology and natural history of the virus. An additional R3 million has been  available from the International Cooperation and Resources (ICR) Funds within DSI for international cooperation.

• Secondly, the Department has availed R12 million for SA testing of drugs for Covid-19 treatment.

• The Technology Innovation Agency (TIA) is also considering to make funds available to fund some diagnostic and sequencing work.

• The DSI is also engaging with the Department of Health, the Medical Research Council, and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority with a view to mobilising funding, reprioritising research strategies and creating an enabling ethical and regulatory framework to facilitate research on the COVID-19 virus.

• Strategies for the management of mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 infections will be considered and prioritised for further development, costing and implementation. The regulatory and ethics research agenda will include the review and approval of ethical and regulatory challenges pertaining to clinical research. The Department will also prioritise surveillance strategies with a view to funding the top priorities.

• Preliminary work on the development of vaccines has started with University of Cape Town (UCT), Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Biovac. Also, the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA) A is currently engaging with other sources of data and modelling groups, refining their assumptions with a view to produce an updated model of the spread of the epidemic over time. 
","• A National Command Council comprising several ministries has been established to implement protocols planned to curb the spread of the virus.  Reporting to it is an  inter- ministerial sub-committee, which has been established to coordinate a national framework for research on COVID-19.  This Committee consists of representatives from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), National Research Foundation, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), and the University of Cape Town (UCT). The overall aim of this sub-committee will be to mobilize funding, prioritise research strategies and create an enabling ethical and regulatory framework to facilitate research. The focus will be to support research that will focus on surveillance, therapeutics and understanding the local epidemiology and natural history of the virus, specifically by mobilising funding, reprioritising research strategies and creating an enabling ethical and regulatory framework to facilitate research on the COVID-19 virus.  This effort will, thus, focus on describing the epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as addressing diagnostic, therapeutic, host and viral factors that may facilitate transmission or protect against infection. Research topics being considered include among others: diagnostic tests; targeted surveillance to establish risk factors among frontline staff for service delivery; trials for the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of health care workers; the identification of antibodies in patients in South Africa who have successfully cleared the infection; and vaccine development.
• To enhance the role of data and evidence in supporting the response to the COVID-19 emergency, a central situational awareness platform is also being established at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to provide a single view of the reality.
","The DSI is participating in several multilateral coordination platforms for facilitated by UNESCO, the OECD, and others.  The Department is also maintaining active contact with its sister ministries across the world and the diplomatic community in South Africa to share information and proactively identify opportunities for cooperation.   A specific focus is on African regional and continental cooperation.","Data science is at the heart of the South African response to Covid-19 drawing on capacities across the science system, e.g. from the astronomy and theoretical physics communities.   The Department of Science and Innovation through the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research has successfully commissioned and finalized the physical set-up of a core situational awareness platform.  Currently, the core of the platform is health data but over time, we intend to integrated the system with other types of data to provide a more robust platform that can provide holistic decision support to the National Command Centre.  A joint CSIR and Department of Health team are hard at work in creating a range of data warehouses including the current geographic spread of the disease, current cases, health vulnerabilities, and location of health and other facilities, amongst others.  Initial visualisations have been completed and these will be continuously enhanced and improved. We thank the team which worked on this system for the efforts and commitments.  Protocols and arrangements are also being facilitated by the DSI to enable the situational awareness platform to draw in information from other sources. This includes the results of the modelling efforts of various modelling teams on a regular basis.  Initial work, led by a team at the University of Pretoria, have also started mobilizing continent-wide networks to build databases on covid-19 cases. Of particular strategic importance for the South African response effort is the situation in our neighbouring countries.  Protocols and improved management arrangements for the facility will be finalized to protect the health and wellness of the core team.  The team has also identified opportunities for accessing key data sets held by the private sector for the explicit purpose of strengthening our situational capacity capabilities. The support of our private sector partners in this regard is crucial.   The situational awareness platform is flexible and dynamic and will be improved and customized based on the prevailing decision support requirements of the National Command Centre.","The situation is fast evolving, thus, it is difficult to predict the exact impact at this time.   However, it is clear the impact on South African economic growth will be significant and science and innovation will have a crucial role to play to boost growth, continuing the fight against poverty, unemployment and inequality.   The Department is currently finalising the Decadal Plan, which will be an implementation framework for its 2019 White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation and which will include the measures to address the Covid-19 impact.","Comprehensive measures to support small, medium, and micro enterprises during this time will also be available to support qualifying actors in the South African National System of Innovation.  Our measures specifically targeting the STI system will be communicated in due course.","Building an evidence base on behavior and perceptions with regard to Covid-19 is an important priority.   Thought the Human Science Research Council (HSRC),  an online survey is conducted to better understand current behaviours and patterns.  As at 27 March 2020, about 2,400 people have responded to the survey. The sample size has increased but a statistician has been commissioned to assess the quality of the responses and data after which analysis can be done.   The public will be kept informed on the outcome of the results of this survey.  The HSRC is also currently pulling together a range of efforts in this space including work specifically focus on rural communities (SAPRIN), social media sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques.   A number of researchers as well as private sector players have expressed a willingness to assist. Follow-ups are being made on how best they can support a national effort. A call has been made to survey companies in the private sector to join hands with government to better understand the behaviours and perceptions of our people.  Through the HSRC a system will be also be introduced of dynamic updates on behavior and perception issues as these will change on an almost daily basis.  The Department continue to update the public on measurers that it will continue to introduce working together with other government departments and social partners."
Spain,2020-04-01 14:34:49.000,"Since March 14th, the Alarm State Managing Board is composed namely by Health, Defense, Home Office and Transportation Ministries. The Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICIN) provides scientific and technical support to the Presidency and to the Managing Board.

Scientific advice and research and technical capabilities on COVID-19 are provided mainly by: 
(i) the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII), depending on the Ministry for Science and Innovation (MICIN) and attached to the Ministry of Health, responsible for funding and executing national biomedical research, and housing the National Center of Epidemiology; and 
(ii) CSIC, that has also mobilized its capabilities in biological and health research, including international reference research centers such as the National Centre of Biotechnology. 

The government has appointed six highly recognized clinical experts and scientist, mainly in the epidemiology field, as members of the Spanish “COVID-19 Scientific and Technical Committee”, to inform policy making and provide scientific advice to the government management board. https://www.msn.com/es-es/noticias/espana/constituido-el-comité-cientifico-del-covid-19-conoce-quienes-están-al-frente/ar-BB11vJrl

The Ministry of Science and Innovation has also established a set of critical infrastructures and RDI centers to continue their work on Covid-19.

Similar initiatives to provide the best available scientific knowledge are being promote by Research Performing Organizations such as CSIC establishing a specialized scientific advisory group among CSIC researchers.

https://www.isciii.es/QueHacemos/Servicios/VigilanciaSaludPublicaRENAVE/EnfermedadesTransmisibles/Paginas/InformesCOVID-19.aspx","Research on COVID-19 requires international collaboration at different levels, but concerted actions for STI policies are still under discussion. Spain throughout the Ministry for Science and Innovation is actively participating in the definition of a common European and international response to COVID-19 in the domain of research and innovation, to accelerate results and joint efforts in order to avoid fragmentation and duplication. 

Spanish research groups actively involved in the European COVID-19 Horizon 2020 Call include: participation in a multidisciplinary network I-MOVE-COVID-19 (ISCIII); modelling projects such as RiPCoN (IRB) and EXSCALATE4CoV (BSC), diagnostic such as CONVAT (CIN2-CSIC); and treatment projects Solnatide (IRB) and MANCO (CNB-CSIC).

Spain participates in established European fora and platforms including the Health Policy Platform and its Health Security Committee, while shows its commitment to participate in a dedicated space on the Health Policy Platform (HPP) for research teams to share information as soon as it will be set up by the EC. 

Spain also has particular interest in setting up a Working Group on Clinical Case Management (including diagnosis; treatment etc.) under the auspices of the Health Security Committee, where Spain asked for the EU wide support in terms of health professionals (https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/preparedness_response/docs/ev_202003252_sr_en.pdf). 

STI priorities, as supported by MICIN, should focus in an EU and international coordinated action on COVID-19 in the short, medium and long term, though in the short-term urgent action is required. In the short term Spain’ priorities include: 
(1) Addition of laboratory testing – strategies, capacities in Member States; 
(2) Digital solutions for healthcare advice and prompt sharing of clinical practices; (3) full open access to research results and research data; 
(4) Additional public funding for research and innovation in COVID-19 both EU and national sources, in full synergy.
(5) Set up a platform to coordinate R&I activities and national, EU and international level including specific areas such as vaccines, clinical trials, treatments as well as mapping of ongoing research activities.
(6) Promote the use of super computing capacities (i.e. Barcelona Supercomputing Center) and shared services at European and international levels.

In addition, different European groups and initiatives are promoting actions to gather information in specific areas of STI and establish common actions to work jointly. For instance in the context of ESFRI (European Forum for Research Infrastructures) a dedicated site will be deployed to open European and National Research Infrastructures to demands of research on COVID-19, specific access calls, activities in place, etc. 

EOSC  (European Open Science Cloud) initiative is implementing different kind of actions to offer services in base the capacities already available to compute and share data to cope with matters related to the Coronavirus, and foresee to coordinate resources and services at European, national and regional level.
Other research specific fora in which Spain actively support EU cooperation include Horizon 2020’ program committees aimed at establishing proper administrative measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the research community (suspending calls; stopping cost and GA administrative procedures; considering a flexible allocation of research funds directly to Covid-19 funds, etc.  

The Ministry for Science and Innovation is participating through Agencia SINC of the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT) in the European Science-Media Hub of the European Parliament to compile a list of reliable information sources, ranging from recognized official international webpages providing daily updates, to data and maps, as well as a selection of resources tailored for reporters and for tackling the spread of disinformation on the topic.","The Spanish government through the Ministry of Health’ web page offers specific information on COVID-19 addressing health professionals, citizens and the press.

The Ministry of Science and Innovation’ web page gathers all relevant information regarding scientific actions taken at national level on COVID-19 including main initiatives and impact in current calls. The Carlos III Institute of Health also provides updates on the epidemiologic data that are made available on this website. 

To refute misleading information, the COVID-19 Scientific Analysis Group, with the support of ISCIII specialists, provides information on scientific advances and possible hoaxes and rumors that may arise. This communication is made available through the Cabinet of the Minister of Science and Innovation (MICIN) in coordination with the Secretary of State for Communication.

The Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT), hosted by MICIN, also contributes to communicate scientific advances on COVID-19:

The Royal Decree Law has also included a dedicated CDTI budget line to provide up to 500 M€ in direct support to mid-caps and SMEs throughout partially reimbursable grants, with no need for any financial guarantee or collateral, seeking to facilitate access to capital for ongoing R&I projects or innovations needed to face the COVID 19 consequences. 

The Spanish research against COVID-19 is competitive and will bring results with the purpose to strengthen it in the research for the COVID-19 different measures has been put in Place:

• The Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) which depends on the Ministry of Science and Innovation, has launched the COVID-19 call to finance research projects on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. This call will have 24 million euros available, as approved by Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of 17 March, on extraordinary urgent measures to deal with the economic and social impact of the new coronavirus. With this new resources, the ISCIII, as a health research funding body, will develop an urgent program of aid for projects and programs that aim to generate knowledge about the infection: to analyze and know the biology of the virus; to develop new therapeutic and prophylactic options, including vaccines; to develop an epidemiological surveillance system and to analyze its impact from the point of view of the health services.

Research areas
The initiatives presented, which may be based on projects already under development or be new initiatives, should focus on the following areas:

•  Development of techniques for rapid virological diagnosis of COVID-19, transferable to the industrial field and applicable to health care, with a priority focus on the diagnosis of early stages of infection and the management of severe cases to optimize stratification and health care.
• Clinical, biological and molecular characterization of the disease, with analysis of clinical stages, prognostic stratification and possible complications.
•  Development of innovative therapies, new antiviral, antiseptic and disinfectant molecules against SARS-CoV-2; studies of antiviral resistance and the effectiveness of non-pharmacological, prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.
• Characterization of SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of genetic and antigenic variation of the virus and management of the immune response and virus-host interaction.
• Development of vaccines, analysis of their efficacy and applicability
• Epidemiological surveillance and molecular study of COVID-19, with analysis of the incidence of mortality, morbidity and lethality; study of environmental and social factors of the spread, risk factors and population dynamics of the infection.
• Use of artificial intelligence tools and massive analysis of integrated data oriented to the epidemiological control of the COVID-19.
• Socio-economic impact of the disease: use of primary care resources, general hospital resources and critical care resources.

Research projects must respect the fundamental principles established in the current wording of the Declaration of Helsinki, promulgated by the World Medical Association, in the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, as well as comply with the requirements established in Spanish legislation in the field of biomedical research, personal data protection and bioethics.

In addition, the National Biotechnology Centre (CNB) of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) will receive 4.45 million € for coronavirus research. CSIC is going to promote the development of its current research and advance in protection strategies against SARS-CoV2. CNB is a worldwide pioneer in a method for cloning viruses that allows them to be genetically manipulated to attenuate their virulence and achieve a vaccine. The team led by professors Luis Enjuanes and Isabel Sola is already working on a project to study the mechanisms of pathogenesis of the new coronavirus. 

The CNB project has six objectives: to generate basic tools and experimental models for the development of protection strategies; identification and testing of antiviral compounds for the treatment of SARS-CoV2; development of specific monoclonal antibodies for protection against the infection; development of the next generation of vaccine candidates; molecular, structural and functional characterization, and computer modeling to understand the spread of the new coronavirus.

The ISCIII, the CNB and other research centers have been declared critical health infrastructures and therefore remain fully operational for COVID-19 research.

In the domain of “clinical trials” related with the COVID19 the Spanish Agency for Drugs and Health Products (Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) has authorized two new clinical trials with a new molecule (remdesivir) for patients with severe respiratory disease. The Ministry of Health is also involved in clinical trials with WHO with drugs related to HVI.

---Innovation---

MICIN throughout CDTI – Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology- has been launching extraordinary measures to contribute to the fight against COVID19 and to support business R&I activities and capacities to prevent the slowdown of innovation in Spain, protect business R&I employment and maintain the competitiveness of the Spanish economy through innovation. Actions are part of current CDTI programs, and special attention will be paid to those proposals that may contribute to COVID19 health emergency. The measures adopted include:
1. Exemption from guarantees (from March 14, 2020) requested in partially reimbursable grants for R&I projects of SMEs and midcaps ranging from 0,5-1,0  Million EUROS for SMEs, to 3 Million EUROS for midcaps. For R&I projects related to products considered emergency by the Government in relation to COVID-19, the exemption of guarantees will be doubled. This measure will mobilize around 500 million EUROS.
2. Fast track for proposals in order to help business to maintain its R&i initiatives and prioritizing projects related to COVID19 products.
3. Flexible administrative procedures: (1) extension of justification periods by one month for finalizing projects; (2) flexibility in the repayment of partially reimbursable grants; 
4. From March 14, 2020 to June 30, 2020: exemption of payment of interests on principal and/or ordinary for companies benefiting from partially reimbursable grants, when the payment is made within a maximum period of 4 months from it is due. This measure will only be applicable to companies that have a valid loan contract with CDTI.
5. Expansion of the “Direct Expansion Line (LIC-A)” currently limited to Andalusia, Canary Islands, Castilla y León, Castilla-La Mancha, Comunidad Valenciana (excluding the city of Valencia), Extremadura, Galicia and Region of Murcia, to the entire national territory
6. Flexibility of criteria for accessing to “Innvierte Coinversión” (until June 30, 2020) to especially support SMEs and facilitate access to capital through CDTI co-investment mechanism. CDTI will accelerate time to funding -the minimum time from investors’ analysis to approval-. Innvierte's initial minimum investment requirement is reduced to 250,000 EUROS, jointly considering all investors are leveraged. For actions aimed at technological developments related to COVID19, Innvierte investments may be below 250,000 EUROS to accelerate innovative projects uptake.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation has started to develop agreements with business associations regarding some dimension of the responses. For example, with the telecom operators to guarantee the connectivity in the network, to explore the use of AI tools applied to the personal cell phones to monitor the diffusion of contagious, etc.

The Ministry of Industry has also started negotiations with sectoral business associations that represent to switch current production lines to produce manufacturing health products.

The main initiatives developed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation are already detailed in Q1A. The Ministry of Science and Innovation and Ministry of Industry are also coordinating different innovation initiatives to foster collaboration with the industrial sector in order to provide health and sanitary products and services such as health monitoring apps; respiratory devices; and the elaboration of Individual protection equipment.
","The main initiatives developed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation are already detailed in Q1B.

The Ministry of Science and Innovation has also joined international efforts to ensure open access to scientific publications on COVID-19. Spain has joined the declaration signed by USA, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Portugal, Singapore and the United Kingdom, to promote access to all the information published on the coronavirus pandemic, a key effort to contain SARS-VOC-2 and reduce its impact. The European Commission will also establish that all the publications supported by EU R&I funds should be open access, excepting the rules of commercial publication rights. At the suggestion of Australia, Spain has supported the study of the possibility of also exempting global patent regulation, with the aim of speeding up the licensing and technology transfer processes, in order to manufacture certain products worldwide.

Most of the European groups, committees and initiatives continuing operating during the containment period. Many of them intend to share initiatives put in place and exchange lessons learnt in the different European and third countries in different domains in relation the COVID-19, e.g. in ESFRI context, an exercise has been launched to learn about how national research infrastructures are managing the crisis and what resources are being offered to work in the different aspects related to the health crisis, national delegates (i.e. ministry or funding agencies' public employees) responsible for the RIs policies in their countries gather relevant information from national RIs managers and users.","Different measures have been put in place, in particular in the EOSC framework EOSC Synergy H2020 project that is coordinated by Spain a new COVID19 Galaxy service has been implemented.
https://www.eosc-synergy.eu/covid19-galaxy-service-eosc-synergy/

The service supports researchers who wish to run computational models for modelling and analysing the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The computation is steered via the Galaxy Portal. The platform offers a series of datasets collections, although every user can download its own data:
• All Coronavirus sequences from the China National Centre for Bioinformatics (CNCB) – nearly 40K sequences.
• The collection of 961 2019-NCOV samples from China National Centre for Bioinformatics (CNCB)
• A reference genome of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1, accession number NC_045512.2.
• The collection of 170 SARS-CoV-2 samples from Genebank
• Reference genome indexes for bwa, gatk and bowtie2 for the NC_045512.2 SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1, can be built.
","In the short term, the COVID-19 sanitary crisis is having a dramatic negative impact at the Spanish economy and to the Spanish System for Science and Innovation also. Currently, it has stopped or slowed down the current calls and the administrative procedures. The economic impact will be translated in difficulties to follow the positive investment trends of our systems. More importantly, at the strategic level. Currently Spain is finishing the future Strategy for Science and Innovation and health sector will be part of the main challenges.

At short and medium-term at the economic level. After the economic crisis, while Spain showed a positive path of economic growth it was slowly advancing in terms of investments towards RDI policies. Regarding Research and Innovation (R&I), Spain remains a ‘moderate innovator’ with declining-flat overall performance relative to that of the EU. However, while the central government budget for R&I has been growing slightly since 2013 and the relative level remains very low and with modest intensity of the Spanish Business Expenditure on Research and Development (BERD). Thus, the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis will impact in the recovery public and private investment with, perhaps, a window of opportunity in the health sector due to the strength in the centers, initiatives, groups and projects in the sanitary area.","The Government has started to approve stimulus packages. 

The first one was included in the Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of 17 March, on extraordinary urgent measures to deal with the economic and social impact of the new coronavirus.  The main focus of this first package has been proving loans and soft credit lines for business and reducing the effect of economic and social damage of the containment strategy adopted. As reported in previous questions specific  EUR 30 million new R&D funding was approved and up to 500 million € soft loans for innovation companies was approved for carry on related COVID19 projects.

New stimulus packages are under study.

Switzerland,2020-05-20 16:48:09.000,"Policymaking requires a broad range of knowledge. To acquire and develop this knowledge, the federal administration carries out or commissions research activities. In view of the diversity of problems, the responsibility of research in government lies with the various specialized offices. In addition, these offices have their own specific networks and commissions to advise them.

In general, the government works closely with research. In the current crisis, the federal government wants to make even greater use of the potential of the Swiss scientific community. A scientific advisory group will answer ad hoc questions to the federal government, if necessary involving other researchers; see Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force (https://ncs-tf.ch/en/).

The Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force is:
- providing the Federal Council Coronavirus Crisis Unit KSBC, the Federal Department of Home Affairs FDHA (Federal Office of Public Health FOPH) and the Federal           Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research EAER (State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI) with its scientific knowledge to assist the political authorities decision–makers in reaching decisions;
- acting as an advisory body to the cantonal authorities on scientific matters;
- identifying fields and opportunities for research where the Swiss scientific community can make an important contribution to understanding and combating COVID-19;
- identifying opportunities for innovation where Swiss scientific know-how can contribute to COVID-19 related products or services.

Ten expert groups (as of Mai 11th 2020) are focusing on the most urgent and time critical issues. Further expert groups may be set up according to emerging needs and in close cooperation and consultation with the commissioning bodies (Mandate, Topics & Expert groups, Policy Briefs, Situation report etc. see https://ncs-tf.ch/en/).

On March 20th 2020, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences issued medical-ethical guidelines for triage in intensive care units. They apply when an emergency occurs with a large number of seriously ill patients and rationing decisions will be necessary (https://www.samw.ch/en/Ethics/Topics-A-to-Z/Intensive-care-medicine.html). News (interim report on patient triage, guidelines, recommendations etc. see https://www.samw.ch/en/News/News.html).

","Two times a week, the government provides information at the highest level (Federal Council) at press conferences. This is supplemented by information from experts.

The Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force was set up to act as a scientific advisory body to the political authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Task Force is publishing Policy Briefs that focus on a wide range of the most pressing scientific issues to better understanding and managing the pandemic (see https://ncs-tf.ch/en/policy-briefs). The Task Force is currently preparing lay summaries of the published Policy briefs, to ensure that the information reaches a broader audience.

The dialogue between science and society is one of the main tasks of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. Recently, they released a COVID19 related video entitled “What Swiss Scientists want Young People to know” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmACHtK0LLw).
","The Federal Council has set up a Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force, which provided science advice to the governmental and cantonal actors in charge of the crisis management. The Science Task Force consists of a group of around 70 high profile scientists working on ten topics. Based on the available scientific evidence, the Task Force provides recommendations in Policy Briefs, which are publicly available at www.ncsf-tf.ch.

Mathematical Modelling is one of the Expert Groups providing actively advice to the Federal Government. Prediction models to describe the epidemic are publicly available on the Task Force website. They are regularly updated. Furthermore, the Digital Epidemiology Expert Group substantially contributes to shaping the testing-tracing-isolating-quarantining strategy. Experts from the EPFL participating in this group developed a proximity app, which should support digital tracing and keep the number of new cases low.

Research data under the SNSF Special Call and the NRP 78 ""Covid-19"" must be made available for researchers and authorities worldwide and without delay at the latest at the end of the project.

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) has set up special registry for Covid-19 research including projects of the SNSF, Innosuisse and EU-projects with Swiss participation (http://www.snf.ch/de/fokusForschung/newsroom/Seiten/news-200518-uebersicht-schweizer-forschung-zu-covid-19.aspx).

On March 24th 2020, Swiss Universities, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries appealed to all publishing houses to remove paywalls on scientific publications supporting by this way the appeal of the International Coalition of Library Consortia (ICOLC). In the current exceptional circumstances, scientific results need to be shared immediately and transparently to bolster the fight against the new virus.


","On 16 March, the Federal Council classified the situation in Switzerland as an ""extraordinary situation"" and introduced various restrictive measures that also affect the functioning of the STI system. The institutions concerned are reacting pragmatically to the problems arising in the short term (e.g. extension of submission deadlines).

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) provides flexible solutions for researchers: extension of mobility fellowships, extending projects, evaluation of career funding schemes etc. (see Coronavirus: SNF update; http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/directaccess/coronavirus-snsf-update/Pages/default.aspx).

Researchers involved in Horizon 2020 Projects or preparing for upcoming calls have difficulties fulfilling their research activities on time. Switzerland is involved in the discussions with the European Commission, Member States and Associated Countries on how to support ongoing and future research activities accordingly.
","The Federal Council is currently doing everything to coordinate the various activities and players in the health, research and innovation sector as well as to support the economy to help overcome the corona crisis.

Existing competences and research capacity in Turkey have been taken into account and collaborative funding mechanisms have been utilized to reach immediate solutions to tackle COVID-19 infection in the fields of drugs, vaccines, diagnostic kits and intensive care devices. 
- In the area of drugs and vaccines, all relevant actors in Turkey have been gathered and a COVID-19 Technology Platform was created. TÜBİTAK mobilized an existing support mechanism, namely “High Technology Platforms (TUBITAK 1004)” to provide required funding for this initiative. TÜBİTAK funded a bundle of research projects, which are being implemented in accordance with the roadmap and strategic milestones of the COVID-19 Technology Platform.  A common sense of strengths and challenges have been developed by the actors who are involved in this network for co-creating high value-added products to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The roadmap is composed of 15 different projects including biotechnological and chemical drugs and vaccines for SARS-COV-2 virus. The Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Institute of TÜBİTAK has been given the role of coordinating this platform. There are 225 researchers coming from 25 different universities, 8 public bodies and 8 private sector organisations. The roadmap including 15 projects was written in only 10 days thanks to existing research competences in Turkey. All of the projects are planned to be finalized in nine months. 
- There is also a coordination between TÜBİTAK and the Directorate of Health Institutes (TÜSEB). TÜSEB is responsible for supporting clinical trial phases of these projects. Toxicity testing and validation studies in animal models will be accomplished immediately and the results will be transferred to TÜSEB for clinical trials.  

Fast Tracked Support for Private Sector: 
- TÜBİTAK has also provided specific funding opportunities to the private sector in Turkey that has been fast-tracked at this challenging time. TÜBİTAK opened a specific call, namely “Struggling with COVID-19”, dedicated to private sector on 26 March 2020. This call focused on topics such as intensive care devices, diagnostic kits, masks, protective clothing, computing applications for tracing the spread of COVID-19, disinfectant, vaccine and drugs. The call ended on 2 April 2020 and 444 applications were received. All relevant projects will immediately start in April.  

Young Researchers as a crucial part of the Struggle with COVID-19:
- TÜBİTAK has opened a specific scholarship call, namely “STAR- Intern Researcher Fellowship Programme” dedicated to young researchers who are willing to take part in COVID-19 projects. The call will stay open between 8-19 April 2020. This support mechanisms is designed in response to the high demand received from undergraduate, graduate and doctorate students and post-doc researchers to contribute to the national struggle with COVID-19.

Coronathon and Support for Entrepreneurs:
- The Ministry of Industry and Technology together with the private sector organized a Coronathon event for entrepreneurs who have potential to provide technology based solutions for COVID-19 pandemic. This event was held on 21-22 March 2020.  More than 150 projects competed and more than 150 mentors took roles to help entrepreneurs. 
- TÜBİTAK is providing complementary support to the awardees of this Coronathon competition in collaboration with some of the selected Technology Transfer Offices. Technology transfer offices (Boğaziçi University TTO, İTÜ Çekirdek and METU TTO) will use a top-up fund provided by TÜBİTAK in order to support entrepreneurs through their accelerator programs. These technology transfer offices also act as implementing bodies evaluating the business plans of young and innovative candidate entrepreneurs in the Techno-Entrepreneurship Support Program of TÜBİTAK. ","The COVID-19 Technology Platform has been established in the area of drugs and vaccines with the participation of all relevant actors in Turkey. This platform is supported by TÜBİTAK to develop domestic technology based solutions to cope with the COVID-19 infection. This platform constitutes a good example for a co-creation research hub. There are 225 researchers coming from 25 different universities, 8 public bodies and 8 private sector organisations. TÜBİTAK is providing grants to 15 projects, 8 of which are dedicated to drug development, while  the rest are dedicated for development of vaccines for the SARS-COV-2 virus.      ","TUBITAK has initiated bilateral and multilateral cooperation actions to support joint RDI projects with the aim of facilitating scientific collaboration between Turkish researchers and their colleagues in other countries. Joint RDI project calls with China and Thailand are at the stage of mutual agreement on topics; more joint calls are intended with South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands and France. Within the scope of these bilateral calls, research projects that qualify for providing immediate solutions will be supported with a maximum duration of 9-12 months. The collection of project proposals and evaluation procedures will be much more rapid than the conventional agenda of calls; the intention is to start all projects in mid-June 2020.

TUBITAK also plans to launch a multilateral call that focuses on the private sector, in collaboration with Canada, Germany, Austria, Spain, France, the Netherlands and South Korea. The objective of this call will be the improvement of disease monitoring technologies utilized in personal protective equipment, disinfection materials, diagnostic and test kits and other therapeutics in the COVID-19 pandemic. This international call will focus on RDI projects of SMEs and large industrial organizations and the support will be provided for a maximum of 9 months. Intense efforts are being made to open this call at the end of April 2020.  
","TUBITAK’s (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) ULAKBİM (National Academic Network and Information Center) currently provides a ""National Academic Network"" service with a capacity of 140 Gbps as the global Internet connection and European Academic Network (GEANT) connection service to Turkish researchers. In the period of combating COVID-19, researchers' access to information from virtual media has become a key issue. Moreover, with the measures taken for COVID-19, our universities will continue their spring term education as distance/open/digital education, which has resulted in the need to increase internet capacities and bandwidth demands. In order to meet these needs, ULAKNET has been working with the Turkish major telecom company, Türk Telekom, to open new ports on the main backbone circuits, consisting of Ankara, Izmir and Istanbul.  In this context, the capacity of approximately 100 ULAKNET circuits has been increased by an average of 60%. Approximately 160,000 researchers and over 7 million university students;  210 different institutions and sub-units including all public universities, some private universities, National Library, Council for Higher Education benefit from this service. Until now, all the requests from universities in terms of internet capacity increase have been met.
Considering the distance education services provided through cloud services, a significant number of universities currently offer distance education via ULAKBulut. In this sense, a video conferencing system has been established to meet the needs of universities. Additional backbone networks such as the one in İzmir, are planned to be opened soon. ","In the scope of RDI support mechanisms and programs, priority has been given to themes related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Besides the calls published on vaccines, therapies, drug design and biomedical equipment, one of the high technology platforms funded by TUBITAK has been assigned to Covid-19 drug and vaccine development.  Another call will be launched on the socio-economic, societal and industrial effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Deadlines of calls within RDI support programs, scholarship programs, STI human resources development programs, and science and society activities have been postponed. Digital systems for online project proposal evaluation, peer review and panels have been established. It is foreseen that the procedures for support programs will continue digitally until the effects of the pandemic subside. ","The stimulus package for supporting the economy do not have an RDI pillar. However, the budget for public support for RDI has mostly been allocated to Covid-19 RDI activities. ",
United Kingdom,2020-03-31 23:38:43.000,"UK Government decisions both nationally and in the devolved administrations are guided by advice from the Chief Medical Officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and from the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, and from other experts.  

The UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) provides scientific and technical advice to support senior government decision makers during emergencies. SAGE is chaired by the government Chief Scientific Advisor and co-chaired by the government Chief Medical Officer during health-related emergencies (https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage). SAGE is responsible for ensuring that coordinated scientific advice is provided to Ministers in the Government emergency committee (COBR). 

SAGE advice is fed into COBR through the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, alongside advice on the social, economic, operational and policy considerations. The Government Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Medical Officer attend COBR as required. SAGE relies on external science advice and on advice from expert groups. During COVID-19 this includes the: New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG); Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) (Department for Health and Social Care); Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B).

","The Prime Minister has highlighted the need for ongoing international cooperation, particularly through the G20, to share expertise, support the global economic system and strengthen the ability of vulnerable countries to tackle the virus. He has stressed the need to support the WHO’s appeal and support vaccine development through the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

The UK has also pursued bilateral coordination.  An example was the joint statement on 12 March by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) of China highlighting their shared commitment to strengthening global collaborations and encouraging openness and data sharing to help ensure diagnostics, vaccines and prevention measures are developed rapidly for the benefit of every nation.

","The Government is promoting advice on Covid-19 through websites such as https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus and https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/ and has launched a Coronavirus Information Service on WhatsApp. The Government texted all mobile phone users across the UK to inform them of new rules announced by the Prime Minister, having previously sent text messages to the vulnerable as part of a shielding package. 

UKRI has launched a new website for anyone interested in the science of COVID-19. CORONAVIRUS – THE SCIENCE EXPLAINED provides authoritative and up-to-date explanations of the scientific evidence behind the COVID-19 pandemic. Developed with the support of the UK Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Chief Medical Adviser, Professor Chris Whitty, the articles have been curated by a team of research scientists working in coronavirus, virus and relevant related fields at the Universities of Oxford, Glasgow and Edinburgh, Imperial College London, King’s College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Topics include evidence and facts about the virus, information on how people are infected and the treatment options. The site will start small and the intention is to rapidly populate it with further articles.

Researchers from UKRI’s GCRF Accelerating Achievement for Africa’s Adolescents (Accelerate) Hub have joined forces with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and others to produce evidence-based tips for parents covering aspects such as planning one-on-one time, staying positive, creating a daily routine, avoiding bad behaviour, managing stress, and talking about COVID-19. The set of six one-page parenting tips are available from WHO and UNICEF. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30736-4/fulltext","In February, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) funded a £20m a rapid research call through relevant bodies such as the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), to complement £20m funding announced by the Health Secretary, which will go to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.  So far this has led to six new studies into the novel coronavirus, including testing a vaccine, developing therapies and improving understanding of how to treat COVID-19 (see: https://mrc.ukri.org/news/browse/covid-19-vaccine-therapy-research-boosted-by-six-new-projects-in-rapid-response/), while the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium will map how COVID-19 spreads and behaves by using whole genome sequencing (see: https://mrc.ukri.org/news/browse/uk-launches-whole-genome-sequence-alliance-to-map-spread-of-coronavirus/). The race to find a vaccine for coronavirus will be boosted by £210m of new UK aid funding, following a virtual summit of G20 leaders for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for international research on vaccines (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-record-funding-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine). 

UKRI is continuing significant discussions across industry, government, and academia to identify new ways to utilise existing research and innovation capabilities to tackle the crisis.

On the 31st March UKRI launched a website to invite the submission of proposals for short term projects addressing and mitigating the health, social, economic and environmental impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. There is no closing date – proposals can be submitted at any time. UKRI will support excellent proposals of up to 18 months duration which meet at least one of the following:
• New research or innovation with a clear impact pathway that has the potential (within the period of the award) to deliver a significant contribution to the understanding of, and response to, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts.
• Supports the manufacture and/or wide scale adoption of an intervention with significant potential.
• Gathers critical data and resources quickly for future research use.

","On 11 March, the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out plans in his annual Budget to increase public R&D investment to £22 billion per year by 2024-25. The government will invest that money in the people, ideas and industries that will cement the UK’s world-leading position in science and technologies ranging from nuclear fusion to electric vehicles and life sciences. This landmark investment is the largest and fastest ever expansion in support of researchers and innovative businesses in the UK, taking direct support for R&D to 0.8% of GDP and placing the UK among the top quarter of OECD nations (see: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents).
In his speech, he said this was part of making the right long-term decisions for the UK’s economic security and prosperity. In the short-term, he said that next year funding will grow by 15%, the fastest year-on-year growth on record (see: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/budget-speech-2020).
","Many issues around the coronavirus response relate to behaviour. During the 2009/10 ‘swine flu’ pandemic, SAGE received advice from a subgroup called the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour and Communications (SPI-B&C). On 13 February 2020, SAGE decided to reconvene this group, limiting its remit to behaviour (SPI-B). SPI-B is not asked to comment, and has not commented, on what interventions are effective or when they should be triggered. Instead, the group is asked to provide advice aimed at anticipating and helping people adhere to interventions that are recommended by medical or epidemiological experts. Participants change depending on the topic under consideration. Input has been received from academic specialists in Health Psychology, Social Psychology, Anthropology and History. Experts from Government departments also attend to provide input and to discuss issues they are facing.
