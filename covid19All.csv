Australia,2020-04-02 09:11:20.000,"Health policy development and decision making in Australia is governed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (https://www.health.gov.au/committees-and-groups/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc), which is comprised of the Chief Health Officers of each state and territory and chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of the Australian Government Department of Health. In turn, the AHPPC is advised by its expert standing committees specialising in laboratory testing and public health, among other specialist health related subjects. 

Advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the Australian regulator of medicines and medical devices, is provided on a regular basis to the Department of Health and Department of Industry, Science, energy and Resources.","The Australian Government Department of Health contains the National Incident Room, which is a designated National Focal Point under the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) (https://www.who.int/ihr/publications/9789241580496/en/) . The National Incident Room has been sharing information on Australian testing protocols and response measures through the IHR mechanism to assist with the consideration and development of international capacity building for COVID-19 response. 

Australia’s Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, has been taking part in regular teleconferences with international Chief Scientific Advisers to share information and coordinate actions as required.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) participates in regular teleconferences and shares information under existing confidential sharing arrangements with comparable overseas regulators including USFDA, Health Canada, UK MHRA, and WHO.

National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) funds a Centre of Research Excellence dedicated to emergency infectious disease response – The Australian Partnership for Preparedness Research on Infectious Disease Emergencies (APPRISE) which involves many of Australia’s leading infectious disease researchers, epidemiologists, clinicians etc. APPRISE researchers are well integrated into national committees and international research collaborations and networks that are important in a major infectious disease outbreak. See https://www.apprise.org.au/

NHMRC is also a member of the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), an international network of major research funding organizations which invest in research capacity and capabilities to support the rapid initiation of scientific research in case of an outbreak.
","The Australian Government Department of Health has a COVID-19 communications strategy which supports the provision of evidence based advice to the public on an ongoing basis. Communication methods include but are not limited to: a web-based resource hub (https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-resources) , social media posts and targeted advertisements, paid broadcasts on television, and consistent public messages disseminated by senior Australian Government representatives. In particular, there is a ‘frequently asked questions’ (https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-frequently-asked-questions) resource that is updated frequently to help inform the Australian community and refute misleading information.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is publishing media releases, safety advisories and other information on its website to refute misleading information, where required. These statements are also promoted via our social media channels including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram.

OECD Secretariat additions (30 March 2020):
The Australian Government has developed a website (https://www.australia.gov.au/) to provide the latest Coronavirus news, updates and advice from government agencies across Australia, and implemented a WhatsApp chat. The government also has created an official government “Coronavirus Australia” app allowing citizens to be up to date with the official information and advice. 
","The Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN), a standing committee of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), is Australia’s leading network of expert microbiologists. This group is comprised of public health laboratory representatives from each state and territory of Australia. They meet weekly to provide advice, share information and support other laboratories, such as hospital, community and private pathology providers, when issues arise. So far, the Australian Government has funded or will fund the following R&D initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

- $15 million to fast-track research into treatments from the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) (https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/fast-tracking-research-into-treatments-for-covid-19) via three open competitive grant opportunities: 
o $8 million to identify and develop antiviral therapies for people infected with COVID-19 ($3 million will initially be provided to test up to 10 antiviral therapies to test proof of concept; a further $5 million then available for rapid advancement of the most promising candidates).
o $5 million for clinical trials to better treat and manage COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress. 
o $2 million to support research into development of a vaccine to protect against novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

- More than $2.6 million in cutting-edge diagnostics research at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. (https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/26-million-for-coronavirus-research-including-a-new-simpler-australian-pathology-test)

On 22 March 2020, a funding injection of up to $17 million (https://stories.uq.edu.au/news/2020/17m-shot-in-the-arm-for-uq-covid-19-vaccine-research/index.html) was announced for vital University of Queensland research that could help cut the timeline for an effective vaccine for COVID-19 by six months:
• the Queensland Government will allocate $10 million
• the Australian Government has pledged $3 million to the project led by UQ’s School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences. 
• the Paul Ramsay Foundation has provided a grant of $3.5 million to the University of Queensland, conditional upon the University of Queensland securing another $6.5 million to reach a total of $20 million from government and other sources.

The Australian Government will invest $30 million for COVID–19 research to enable Australian researchers to contribute to global efforts to control the outbreak. Three research areas, in line with the priorities agreed at the recent Coronavirus Research Roundtable, are vaccine development, anti-viral development and respiratory medicine research

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is fast tracking (i.e. accelerating) regulatory assessment for applications for a therapeutic good related to COVID-19. In some cases, for example point of care tests, due to limited information at the time of application, regulatory approval is granted, with strict conditions that follow-up data and studies including stability shelf-life is provided to the TGA.  In addition, a number of exemptions for complying with normal regulatory processes and approvals are in place to facilitate faster access and supply for some tests and PPE medical devices. 
• Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices—Accredited Pathology Laboratories) (COVID-19 Emergency) Exemption 2020 (F2020N00032);(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00032/Download)  and
• Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices—Face Masks and Other Articles) (COVID-19 Emergency) Exemption 2020 (F2020N00033).(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00033/Download) 

See: https://www.tga.gov.au/legal-supply-covid-19-diagnostic-tests

The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) funds a Centre of Research Excellence dedicated to emergency pandemic response – the Australian Partnership for Preparedness Research on Infectious Disease Emergencies (APPRISE). Funding for this network is AUD$5 million over 5 years from 2016 to 2021 (see: https://www.apprise.org.au/). APPRISE is supporting 16 urgent research projects covering areas such as diagnostics, treatment and communication in response to COVID-19. It is joining forces with the NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence in Emerging Infectious Diseases (CREID), to support the national collaborative projects designed to fill areas of critical research need and improve Australia’s emergency response to COVID-19. 
","The Australian Government draws on the expertise of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN) and the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA), through its established decision making governance mechanism. These committees can draw on academic, industry and other stakeholder expertise to inform response measures for COVID-19 and other health emergencies of national concern. The Emergency Response Plan for Communicable Disease Incidents of National Significance: National Arrangements (National CD Plan) (https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-nat-CD-plan.htm)  and the National Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/australian-health-sector-emergency-response-plan-for-novel-coronavirus-covid-19)  outline the response roles and responsibilities of Federal, state, territory and local governments, including engagement with different STI actors, to collaborate on responses to COVID-19. 

The Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) is a specific initiative that engages STI organisations. The MRFF is a research fund set up by the Australian Government in 2015 that provides funding to four overall research themes, focused on patients, researchers, research missions and research translation. There are currently three MRFF grant opportunities open for COVID-19 related activities.
","The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is Australia’s national science research agency. CSIRO has received funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global group that aims to speed up the development of vaccines and cut short the COVID-19 pandemic. CSIRO will receive vaccine candidates agreed by CEPI and begin testing of new potential vaccines and therapeutics to see if they work and are safe. The vaccine developments themselves are being partially funded by CEPI in laboratories around the world including Australia. CSIRO is working closely with the University of Queensland and the Doherty Institute.

CSIRO is also part of a separate consortium established with the University of Queensland in 2019 to rapidly develop vaccines. The consortium was established to create a rapid response pipeline to develop and test new vaccines. The consortium has been tasked by CEPI to develop a vaccine platform for nCoV-2019 in collaboration with CSIRO. ","The Australian Government is investing more than $2.6 million in cutting-edge diagnostics research by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, this will be directed to four strategies, including:  
• A 'one-step' nucleic acid detection, which combines the current extraction of the virus from the patient sample and detection step into one. By avoiding the separate extraction of genetic material, this test saves substantially on critical lab consumables and is also very rapid, with the potential to reduce test turnaround times.
• The development of new testing protocols to enable more individuals to be tested simultaneously, while minimising the number of consumables used and maintain the current turnaround times.
• Rapidly assessing, trialing, and where relevant, validating new diagnostic test kits to ensure they are of the highest quality.
• Assessing how and when to use serology testing. Serology testing could assist with identification of asymptomatic infection, retrospective diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from infection and determining the extent of infection in a population.
","Over recent weeks, requests for COVID-19 testing have increased, as have demands on pathology supplies. It is expected that similar pressures are occurring worldwide due to the increased demand for testing. However, there are sufficient stocks within the Australian laboratory system to meet the current demand. The Australian Government is working closely with public and private laboratories, as well as manufacturers, to secure pathology supplies so that testing capacity can be sustained throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. ",The Australian Government is working closely with laboratories to ensure that Australia maintains the capacity and capability to test for COVID-19.,
Austria,2020-04-03 10:14:52.000,"Austrian research institutions and universities, for example the Austrian Academy of Sciences (OeAW) and the Medical Universities, are regularly consulting policy makers from government institutions and the parliament. Offering their expertise to official decision makers is a part of their legal obligations.

Relevant researchers are also included in the crisis consulting boards. For example: Austrian Federal Ministry of Health “Coronavirus Taskforce”, which provides medical and scientific advice - see 
https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Coronavirus---Taskforce.html
","The responses are coordinated by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research. The focus of international coordination lies within the European Union and is based on regular video conferences between the European Commission and Member States at Directorate-General level.

As a result of these coordination efforts, an “R&I Action Plan for ‘ERAvsCorona’"" is about to be finalised.
","Government authorities aim to inform the public through official channels on ongoing scientific developments on a very regular basis.

The Federal Chancellery established a “digital crisis unit”, which deals with the detection and correction of incorrect information about Covid-19.

The public television channels, as well as private networks, are widely covering scientific developments in their news shows. At the same time special television shows have been aired that offer scientists the opportunity to provide relevant advice and information to a larger public.
","A dedicated Joint Call for COVID-19 with a volume of € 21 Mio. from the two Austrian Federal Ministries,the Ministry of Digitalisation and Economy together with the Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Mobility, Innovation and Technology  was launched in March to support applied research on tests, vaccines and medication against COVID-19 Mio. See https://www.ffg.at/ausschreibung/emergencycall-covid-19. The Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research is supporting its Medical Universities to participate in medical trials with an extra € 2 Mio.

The Austrian Science Fund (FWF) has introduced fast track approval for COVID-19 relevant research.

The Austrian authorities treat all applications for medical trials preferentially in order to grant approval as fast as possible.

Additionally,  Austrian research groups successfully participate in the special Horizon 2020 call at the European level.
","The funding calls mentioned under Q3 are open for joint proposals. They aim at furthering close collaboration and address possible synergies between universities and research institutions, both from the academic and private sector, which we are already registering throughout the Austrian STI system.

We are currently aiming at establishing additional platforms on a national level to better coordinate relevant initiatives.
","The Austrian universities and research institutions are organised in multiple international platforms, such as, for example, the European Academy of Sciences (EurASc), the European university networks, or transnational initiatives such as CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations).

EMBL-EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute) has started to work with interested Member States to establish data hubs that can serve as a forum for data sharing among virologists from all over the world.

A current challenge is to step up our efforts in coordinating all these initiatives in order to create critical mass and to avoid unnecessary duplication.

Via the Horizon 2020 Health Programme Committee, a list of the 8 most urgent research fields related to COVID-19 from GLOPID-R (Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Prevention) and the WHO has been distributed. This list could form the basis for a coordinated action in Europe.
","In Austria, there are currently numerous initiatives, both from the public and private sector, aiming at providing rapid tests, medication and vaccination. Many of those are embedded in international and European partnerships. The initiatives range from academic spin-offs using AI technology to identify agents, big data analysis on the spread of COVID-19 nationally and internationally, university networks manufacturing sanitiser through novel methods, to the social sciences addressing and supporting the current societal challenges. Since the already significant number is constantly growing, providing a representative overview is impossible at the current time.

To name one of the above mentioned initiatives, the Complexity Science Hub Vienna (CSH) has offered new calculations with regard to possible scenarios for the spread of Covid-19. Their publication is offered with the suggestion to base all predictions regarding the duration of the measures issued by the Austrian government on patients in intensive care units and deaths, rather than on infection numbers. 

Another initiative that offers advice on the duration of those measures is a research team from the Technical University in Vienna and one of its spin-off companies. They published a simulation calculation that asks to keep the measures issued in place, but that from a scientific point of view at the current time, more restrictions for the general public are unlikely to have an impact. Therefore, additional measures should put their focus on targeted risk groups. ","The corona crisis will only be solved with the aid of research and innovation. This has been stressed by members of the Austrian government in a joint press statement on March 21st 2020. The corona crisis is a time in which the government, and especially society, strongly rely on the expertise of and support from the STI-system all around the globe. What is currently witnessed is a rapid engagement across disciplines and nationalities of researchers from all institutions to jointly battle the crisis. In times like this, the significance of R&D and its direct impact on all our lives becomes more evident than ever. 

At this point in time, it seems premature to describe the impacts of the Corona pandemic on the STI system in more detail.
","Besides the support measures mentioned in answer to Q3, the Austrian government plans to provide a €38 billion support package for the domestic economy. Within this package, many R&D oriented companies and research institutions are going to be supported. However, it is currently not planned to invest that money in the STI system.",All efforts by the OECD to foster collaboration and exchange of experience among its members are most welcome.
Belgium,2020-03-28 15:55:35.000,"The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) require each Member State to have a structure capable of dealing with any health crisis. To this end, Belgium has set up a strong structure with three components: a Risk Assessment Group (RAG); a Risk Management Group (RMG) and; the National Focal Point (NFP). The RAG conducts public health risk assessments based on epidemiological and scientific data and is composed of experts from the health authorities and Sciensano (a federal research institution which is the leading scientific institution in the epidemiology of infectious diseases); the RMG takes action to protect public health based on the work of the RAG. A special scientific committee was also convened to advise the authorities on the latest scientific developments, so as to assure the swift elaboration of any necessary measures.
","The Belgian government is in constant contact with the World Health Organization and European Union for the latest news and recommendations.

At European level, Belgium provides input and feedback on R&I needs via different fora, such as the EU Horizon 2020 SC1 Health, Wellbeing Programme Committee. 
","Concerning science advice, Belgium's daily briefing to citizens is (as the British newspaper ""Financial Times"" described it) ""fronted not by politicians, but by scientific experts and spokespeople of the Belgium government’s crisis centre"". Those briefings are also used to clarify misunderstandings and to fight back attempts to deviate from the lockdown conditions and rumours. 

Concerning misinformation, Belgium, through its Centre for Cybersecurity, tries to alert people against misleading communication about the coronavirus and provides links to Belgian sites where official reports are available. The Centre has also developed some tools, like an online test to see if you can recognise phishing (see https://www.safeonweb.be/en/quiz/phishing-test). 

At regional level, there are also important initiatives; e.g.: the Flemish agency of Care and Health (agentschap Zorg en gezondheid) has created a dedicated fact checking webpage on its ‘health and science’ website (https://www.gezondheidenwetenschap.be/dossiers/coronavirus) to help debunk fake news on COVID-19.
","In the last two weeks, we have seen in Belgium numerous initiatives to respond to the Covid-19 crisis. However, these are mainly bottom-up. Everywhere around the country, research groups in all universities and in research centres, as well as in companies, have reallocated budgets to address different issues. 

One example is the case of the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) that announced the reallocation of about 1 million Euro of its budgets for its Grand Challenges Programme to COVID-19 projects.

In the region of Wallonia, the BioWin cluster (active in the field of health biotechnology and medical technologies) has developed an interactive platform for centralization of health initiatives related to COVID-19 around 6 urgent themes: manufacturing, supply and recycling of masks for companies; development and repair of ventilators; development and manufacturing of hydroalcoholic gels; development and manufacturing of new diagnostic approaches; development of new treatments; and new sources of funding  (https://www.biowin.org/en/news/covid-19-join-biowins-cooperation-platform).

Another example is the case of ITM (Institute of Tropical Medicine) experts who joined colleagues of the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) to set up an epidemiological database. 

Also the Young Academy (an interdisciplinary and inter-university group of top young researchers and artists in Flanders) launched a number of initiatives to join forces among scientists from all disciplines, including coordination on the production of ventilation equipment and the collection of initiatives in a Slack-environment for scientists.
","Belgium is putting scientific expertise at the service of public health. An example is the case of the specialised physicians of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp (ITM) who recently strengthened the Antwerp University Hospital in the screening and treatment of COVID-19 patients as they are experienced in working with infectious diseases. 

Flanders has organised a taskforce to map, align and promote all public and private digital initiatives that aim to keep the world connected during the pandemic https://www.vlaanderen.be/vlaanderen-helemaal-digitaal

A multidisciplinary consortium consisting of academic researchers, privacy experts and app developers has joined forces to develop a platform to map the further spread of the virus and to better contain the epidemic. The platform combines: a mobile app for citizens; a web app for medical personnel; a back-end for data aggregation; and an AI system to train models. All these components work together to map potential infected clusters, hotspots and super spreading. Contact tracing can furthermore be done more efficiently. Privacy experts have been involved from the outset.

","Belgium is contributing to EU discussions in this area and has participated in a successful way in the recent call for projects launched within the EU R&I framework programme Horizon 2020 (4 out the 17 proposals selected for funding have at least one Belgian participant). Another European initiative in this area is the IMI2 JU call 21 (https://www.imi.europa.eu/apply-funding/open-calls/imi2-call-21).

Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in Belgium are preparing to provide support to African countries with fragile health systems. ITM is monitoring the situation closely and is in touch with its partner countries in Africa. The Institute is available to support public health responses and is considering studies to better understand the possible spread of the virus in these countries.
","There is an increased demand for open science initiatives and a positive response to that demand.

The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) provides computing time for research on Covid-19 both for academics and companies. More information can be found at www.vscentrum.be/covid19.

In Belgium, as in most countries, postdoc evaluations are normally face-to-face, but that cannot be done for the moment. As a consequence, some Belgian universities have already decided to replace face-to-face evaluations with an online expert panel meeting. 

Some Belgian innovators have also seen an opportunity in the negative side effects of social distancing measures. Since queuing and grouping at authorized locations (food stores, pharmacies, hospitals, parks, etc.) may be problematic, the Belgian company Seaters – which normally helps to distribute sponsoring tickets for sports and cultural events – has transformed its product into a Virtual Queuing System. Via that system an appointment voucher for authorized locations can be requested. Each voucher mentions an hour of visit that takes into account the social distancing rules (max. 1 person per 10 m2) and the necessary time per person (max. 30 min. for groceries, for example). The demo version of the platform can be activated nationally in 24 hours.
","In terms of impact, it is clear that many present and future R&I activities (like experiments) are placed on 'hold' (so that resources can be dedicated to the development of a response to the pandemic). This will cause important project delays and may lead, if the current situation is prolonged, to lack of expertise in other S&T areas.
Possible measures some Belgian players are taking include: to make use of the regulatory option to spend means for staff and consumables up to 2 years after the formal end date of the project to finalise the research; to postpone submission deadlines for research proposals; and to invite researchers to indicate in their fellowship reports any problems they encountered due to the coronavirus situation.

Another impact is on Postdoc evaluations. These are normally face-to-face but that cannot happen for the moment.
Measure: reducing the 2-step procedure to a single and online expert panel meeting for the evaluation and ranking of the applications, based on the available evaluation and synthesis reports for the pre-selection step.
",,"Belgium pleads for great international solidarity during this crisis. All possibilities for international aid must be activated.
 
Transparency and exchange of information are essential and existing networks should be used as much as possible such as the Early Warning and Response System (in Europe).

Brazil,2020-04-03 19:00:38.000,"""Rede Vírus-MCTIC - Among the initiatives the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication has carried out to support the fight against Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19), is the creation of an Experts Committee Rede Vírus-MCTIC (Virus-MCTIC Network) on Mar 11th 2020. The idea of creating this Network arose from a meeting held in early February 2020, with the aim of promoting a technical discussion of how science can help Brazil in tackling the problem of emerging viruses, especially the coronavirus. Scientists specialized in the area and representatives from the Ministry of Health participated in the debate. The Virus-MCTIC Network is already working to assist the Government in initial RD&I actions to face this pandemic, as well as in the definition of research priorities related to COVID-19.

The Network plans to use MCTIC Research Units as CERTIFIERS for local producers so that they can manufacture materials to combat COVID-19. These Research Units are spread across Brazil and can respect the distinct nature of Brazilian regions, enabling the use of local sanitizing products, such as alcohol, detergents, masks, moist towels, etc.""

The Ministry of Health of Brazil is also monitoring the situation and establishing protocols and guidelines to deal with the pandemic. The Ministry of Health is in frequent contact with the World Health Organization and with local officials, politicians, medical personal and researchers in order to have the best information available to guide national policy. ","The Brazilian Minister of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications, Marcos Pontes, is representing Brazil in a working group established between high level officials such as Ministers and Chief Scientific Advisers from the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and USA. The objective of this working group is to share research results and information on how science can assist in the decisions and measures that governments are taking to face the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Minister Pontes is also actively participating at the consulting group on scientific responses to CV19 established by UNESCO.
And of course the Brazilian Delegation, with the assistance of the Brazilian scientific community, has been actively involved in the debate on public policies informed by science in the context of WHO. ","The Minister of Health of Brazil has organized meetings with municipal authorities as well as State Governors in order to coordinate response and to provide the best information to the public. Several of these meetings have been led at Presidential level. The Minister Chief of Staff of the Presidency (« Casa Civil ») has also been charged by the President with coordinating a whole-of-government response, involving with all the relevant Ministries, including those responsible for Health, Science and Technology, Economy and social services (« Cidadania »). There are regular meetings with the press to inform the public of the latest developments of the pandemic in Brazil and the official response. The Ministry of Health has published a webpage to bring information to the public (http://coronavirus.saude.gov.br/) and has developed an app (CoronavirusSUS available for IOS and Android systems) which conveys information and advices citizens to take the correct actions (such as searching the closest health center) based on self-evaluation of their health conditions.

Fiocruz, a state-owned foundation and laboratory that engages in research and development of  biotechnology products, has launched the COVID-19 Information for Researchers web page in order to grant access for researchers to scientific and technical publications, situational maps and epidemiological reports (https://portal.fiocruz.br/coronavirus-2019-ncov-informacoes-para-pesquisadores-0). There is also a podcast to provide information for the general public - https://open.spotify.com/show/4JDOjmiNfSoSE5fvExqNNs. ","The Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications of Brazil (MCTIC) established an advisory committee and strategic plan to provide coordinated and quick responses to emerging viruses. This ""Virus-MCTIC Network"" coordinates the efforts of research laboratories with a view to identifying complementarities of infrastructure and activities in the ongoing research on Covid-19, influenza and others. The objectives of the network are the integration of scientific research and development efforts in the area of emerging viruses; definition of research priorities; coordination of ongoing R,D&I initiatives related to emerging viruses; and development of technologies to assist the country in facing those challenges. Researchers and representatives of MCTIC, the Ministry of Health and development agencies participate in the initiative.  

As an example, within this network, the National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM) is already employing tools like computational biology and AI to evaluate the effectiveness of about 2 thousand existing drugs against Covid-19. Computational data tests use atomic structure data and the behavior of Covid-19 proteins to examine the interaction of molecules of available medications with these target proteins, and to pre-select those that show promise in interfering with the infection. Selected molecules will then be tested in vitro to verify its effectiveness in eliminating the virus, which will allow the new use of already available medications. 

The emergency release of R$ 3.4 billion (around USD 700 million) to be used in initiatives to fight the pandemic has recently been approved by the Federal government. The funds will be allocated to the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Defense; and Ministry of Citizenship.From that amount, R$ 100 million (around USD 20 million) will be directed to STI measures, from the National Scientific and Technological Development Fund (FNDCT), to be applied in Research Networks, National Institutes of Science and Technology (INCT) and public calls via the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Funding for Studies and Projects Agency (Finep) 

The funds will be used for emergency support of projects (grants) within the scope of the priorities defined by the Virus-MCTIC Network, including: - Development of diagnostic kits; - Development of vaccines; - Use of advanced technologies for rapid selection of possible drugs; - Large-scale sequencing and monitoring of mutations in SARS-Cov 2 (COVID-19) samples; - Structuring a virus sample bank for scientific studies to understand the disease. 

The State National Postal Service Company (Correios) is acting as the logistics partner for the Virus-MCTIC Network, being responsible for collecting viral material (new coronavirus and influenza) from selected laboratories and delivering them to other labs (in-kind contribution). These are being used in studies on contagion, proliferation of viruses and vaccines for diseases. Scientists working on the matter now have priority in receiving and sending research material, since time is crucial for the effectiveness of research with COVID-19. 

A research call for projects has already been launched on the total of R$ 50 million (around USD 10 million) by CNPq. The call is aimed at projects on diagnosis, vaccines, clinical trials and other research related to the virus. Overall priority is given to the development of a) medications and respective pre-clinical and clinical tests; b) vaccines and respective pre-clinical and clinical tests; c) innovation for the production in large scale of ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) and their related systems; Research, development and innovation in diagnostic tests are also a priority; monitoring and sequencing the virus genome circulating in the country; telemedicine tools.  

The Ministry of Health has authorized the use of telemedicine to care for patients with coronavirus (March 23rd, 2020). To this end, the MCTIC will carry out: I - direct contracting of projects, studies, technologies and innovations; II - public call (s) for contracting projects, studies, technologies and innovations; and III - coordination between organizations in the science, technology, innovation and communications system. 

MCTIC has also launched 7 orders for technology acquisition on the total amount of R$ 50 million (around USD 10 million). They include development of products for genetic sequencing, clinical trials protocol, the application of AI on inhibiting virus replication, development of test kits and vaccines as well as social projects. 

Another initiative by MCTIC is the launch of the platform IdearuMCTIC (www.mctic.gov.br), aimed at connecting ideas and evaluating the maturity of technological solutions related to the challenges imposed by the pandemic. 

Besides that, funding State agencies such as FAPESP (State of São Paulo), Fundação Araucária (State of Paraná) and FAPERJ (State of Rio de Janeiro), as well as funding federal agencies such as CAPES (Ministry of Education), are releasing funds for research on tackling the challenges caused by the pandemic, such as the development of tests or vaccines, as well as the genomic sequencing of the virus. Other entities like EMBRAPII (Brazilian Industrial Research and Innovation Company), SEBRAE (Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Agency), and Porto Digital (Science park located at the State of Pernambuco) are taking efforts for innovative solutions to be developed, such as the fabrication of ventilators and of tests for diagnosis of COVID-19. 

The São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) launched a call for research proposals on COVID-19 within the time limit of 24 months, with a view to understanding the virus` epidemiological characteristics, developing tests and therapies, conducting research on clinical procedures, identifying and evaluating innate immune responses and issues related to the social behavior of the affected population. The total amount of the research call is R$ 10 million (around USD 2 million). 

FAPESP and FINEP, under the PIPE/PAPPE Grant Program, launched a call for research projects on the development of technologies for products, services and processes to fight Covid-19. The research call will allow that participants from previous phases of the Grant program (Phase 1 or Phase 2) to commercialize emergency products or services.  

Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Agency (SEBRAE) will assign R$ 2 million (around USD 400 thousand) to the development of technological solutions by startups and other small and medium-sized enterprises with a view to help the Brazil face Covid-19. The funds will add up to R$ 4 million (around USD 800 thousand) from the Brazilian Industrial Research and Innovation Company (EMBRAPII) and contributions by participating companies and accredited research and innovation centers. Joint resources are expected to reach the total of R$ 10 million (around USD 2 million). The resources may be used for software development, system devices, hardware, medical parts and equipment, and others. 

EMBRAPII has also approved R$ 2.3 million (USD 900 thousand) to the development of mechanical ventilators, that provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide directly from the blood.  

The National Service for Industrial Training (SENAI), through the ""Innovation Call for Industry"", will select projects that help prevent, diagnose and treat Covid-19. It foresees the destination of R$ 10 million (around USD 2 million) for proposals on solutions against problems caused by the virus, with immediate application and results within 40 days, in the areas of consulting, metrology, testing, analysis, research, development and innovation. Examples of these solutions are the manufacture of mechanical respirators and the development of rapid tests for the detection the disease. 

The National Council of State Foundations of Research Support (CONFAP) released a proposal for Brazilian institutions to join the so-called ""Development of therapy and diagnosis for fighting coronavirus infections"" launched by `Innovative Medicines Initiative`, in cooperation with European Union and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). Its objective is to identify new therapeutic agents, early diagnostic systems, and reliable data related to Covid-19. Brazilian partners can participate in a co-financing scheme. The European side plans to disburse EUR 45 million. 

The University of São Paulo (USP) is conducting researches for vaccine development with a quick response against the virus. The work takes advantage of results from previous studies on other types of coronaviruses, which, hopefully, can help in the case of Covid-19. Brazilian research is comparatively safer, as it is based on the creation of a particle similar to coronavirus, the VLP (virus-like particle), equivalent to a hollow virus, without the genetic material and therefore without the transmissibility of the disease.  

The Covid Challenge 19 is an initiative by the Public Persecutor`s Office of the State of Pernambuco (MPPE), the State Health Secretariat of Pernambuco (SES-PE) and Porto Digital. The MPPE and SES-PE offer R$ 1.3 million for innovative and high-impact solutions that can be adopted in a short term, with a view to fighting the virus. The challenge already includes the submission of 543 ideas on 5 areas: a) monitoring the risk groups; b) information flow management; c) monitoring social isolation; d) support for health agents; and e) testing and diagnosis. 
","Brazil is taking expedient measures to respond to the crises. As early as January, the Ministry of Health created an emergency group to monitor the situation, head by the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). In February, the Health Ministry organized a meeting with Secretaries of Health from municipalities and state-level in order to coordinate responses to the coming crises, before there were any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil, and also published the National Contingency Plan for the COVID-19 crises (https://portalarquivos2.saude.gov.br/images/pdf/2020/ marco/25/Livreto-Plano-de-Contingencia-5-Corona2020-21 0x297-16mar.pdf), which organizes the actions to be taken during the development of the pandemic in Brazil, describing levels of response and assigning attributions for different actors. 

Once the pandemic reached Brazil, a crisis committee, head by the office of the Chief of Staff of the Presidency (Casa Civil) was established in order to discuss measures to be taken on a whole-of-government level. Then, an interministerial committee was created, gathering the highest officials from the Federal Government to meet with the President in order to coordinate policy. The meetings include ministers of Foreign Affairs; Defense; Health; Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications; Economy; and others. 
","Fiocruz and the Ministry of Health are developing joint actions with the World Health Organization in order to respond to the crises. Brazilian authorities also take part in meetings with political leaders that are part of multilateral mechanisms such as Prosul (South America) and G20 aimed at coordinating actions. 
As mentioned above, (1.B), the Minister of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications is also articulating with foreign counterparts actions to be taken to tackle the pandemic. 
","Artificial Intelligence, Biocomputing and high performance computing are being applied to develop research and new products. Brazilian infrastructures like CNPEN laboratories and the Santos Dumont and Ogbon Super Computers are part of the Folding@Home project, which donates computing power to run simulations and research. 

Using the Santos Dumont supercomputer Brazilian researchers have sequenced 19 genomes from the COVID-19 variations present in Brazil in just 48 hours. It was possible to identify from which countries and regions of the world came the different strains of COVID-19 that reached Brazil. 

Also, the call for proposals being launched with the extraordinary credit, mentioned above (Q.3), includes support for projects for large scale sequencing of viruses, use of advanced technologies (eg. AI) for medicine selection and support of clinical trials, support for advanced vaccine development platforms (eg. VLP) & Data Science projects for modeling and planning. 
","SFor the short term: 
- Loss of important human capital - Median age for researchers is typically higher than the general workforce - depending on the severity of the crisis; 
- Disruption of ongoing research projects which require physical access to labs, other research facilities or medical facilities;
- Postponement of conferences.
 For the medium term:
- Higher public understanding on the importance of R&D;
- Higher reliance and confidence on remote work and collaboration arrangements, both for Research and work in general;
- Higher perception on the importance of access to scientific information and resources (articles, data, etc)
- Better availability of FAIR research data. 
- The improvement of coordination among different
agents of the STI ecosystem and development of capacity for quick response to immediate threat. 
For the long Term:
- Higher focus on health-related research.
- An increase on the public perception as of the importance to invest in STI.","Yes. As explained above (Q.3), the Federal Government has released R$ 3.4 billion to tackle the challenges of the pandemic, of which R$ 3 billion will be directed to social benefits. On what concerns STI, R$100 million have already being authorized to be invested in research and innovation.  
Other federal economic stimulus packages might also help indirectly the STI system, since they are aimed at provided liquidity to the financial sector (banks) in order to facilitate credit to small and medium enterprises and alleviating tax obligations. 
","Adding to the public sector effort, private enterprises are also engaged in fighting the pandemic. Big companies like the aircraft manufacture Embraer are adapting plants to the fabrication of mechanical ventilators and its components. Startup companies are also developing new products, like 3D printed ventilators and masks, as well as new test kits. They have also offered services like delivery of donations and geolocalization apps to help with the mapping the geographic distribution of the virus.  
The startup Hi Technologies, based in Curitiba, State of Parana, announced the development of a rapid test for Covid-19 detection that provides results in 10 minutes. The large-scale production of the test kit is underway, with delivery of kits in April. The startup is known for the Hilab device, which integrates internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence to perform remote exams by collecting drops of blood in the Hilab (available in pharmacies), that transmits information to the laboratory responsible for analyzing the result, issuing and signing the respective report. Hilab is already capable of testing for HIV, dengue, zika and hepatitis, in addition to measuring cholesterol levels, blood glucose and other issues.  
Governments across Brazil are looking to roll out a system developed that uses geolocation tracking to support actions around the lockdowns intended to slow the spread of COVID-19. Brazilian startup InLoco develops the geolocation technology, which is normally used by companies from sectors such as retail, to securely target and engage with users without the need to share personal information. Users are geotracked through a location map that does not use GPS or beacons, which InLoco claims to be 30 times more accurate than GPS. The startup is headquartered at Porto Digital, a technology innovation cluster in the northeastern city of Recife, where the platform has gone live last weekend. Announcing the measures, the mayor of Recife said the city is tracking at least 700.000 smartphones to identify where the lockdown rules are being followed - many Brazilians, particularly those in vulnerable sections of society, have no choice but continue to work despite the risk. 
The Governance & New Economy Community (Gonew.co), with the support from the Brazilian Association of Startups (Abstartups), launched the campaign StartupsxCovid19, which seeks to map companies with innovative solutions to face the coronavirus crisis. Among other initiatives, mapping will be used to provide information to entities such as the Ministry of Health.

Colombia,2020-03-28 16:56:48.000,,,"● COVID-19 Content Production Strategy

With the aim of providing true information and undermining false beliefs around COVID-19, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation has undertaken an intersectoral strategy of Public Communication of Science and Public Outreach. This strategy includes the following specific components:

i) First, the production of infographics and digital videographies from the technical inputs provided by high-level experts, who participate in an ongoing series of dialogues organized by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia to discuss matters related to COVID-19. This information is the result of an analysis of data collected by the different actors who are leading the fight against COVID-19 in Colombia, presented in a way the public would find pedagogical and easy to understand.  This material is released in collaboration with various actors from the National STI System and other government entities through websites, social networks and other digital media, in order to empower the audiences who access and share this content.

ii) Second, the creation of live, online, participatory dialogues with experts. These spaces allow experts to address some of the most common misunderstandings about the virus and the crisis it has caused, using examples and technical explanations. For this exercise, users can submit questions through social networks, fostering a participatory and dynamic dialogue where citizens are represented. These dialogues are broadcast regularly throughout the period of quarantine declared by the national government.

iii) Finally, a special edition will be produced entitled ""The Coronavirus from different views of the Sciences"" with about 10 different texts and related audiovisual material. This will be an opportunity to make an in-depth reading of the current situation through the viewpoints of different areas of knowledge in relation to COVID-19. This material will be released in approximately 3 weeks, in collaboration with actors of the National STI System and other government entities including the Ministry of Health and shared through their digital media, in order to widen its public reach.
","● Mapping molecular biology laboratories in Colombian Universities:

The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation is leading the initiative for mapping molecular biology laboratories in Colombian universities through a survey designed by the academic sector. This instrument was a task requested by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, the Ministry of National Education and the National Institute of Health of Colombia, with the objective of mapping the capacities of the laboratories in the universities of Colombia to support the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 from the identification of the genetic markers for SARS-CoV-2.

This information will be an essential input to know which laboratories have BCL-2 biosafety standards and have documented and verified procedures for quality assurance, sample traceability and validity of results. Furthermore, the results of the survey will detect if these laboratories have methodological control and endorsement of the tests and service qualification. It is important to clarify that the survey is still in the process of completion by the universities and other entities, therefore the results are not conclusive yet.

● Program: Strengthening and provision of equipment, infrastructure and medical supplies for early detection and care of patients affected by Coronavirus in Colombia ""Covid-19 Colombia""

This project aims to increase the conditions of care for laboratories in frontier areas and vulnerable territories in the departments of Amazonas, Cauca, Chocó, Guajira, Magdalena, Nariño, San Andrés and Vichada in the context of the campaign against COVID-19. The total budget for the project is 19,5 million dollars, with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia contributing 6,5 million dollars and seeking to leverage 13 million dollars. This project arises from the profound imbalance existing between regions in Colombia, where social gaps highlight the need to improve public health equipment and capacities in the border areas and other areas with high levels of vulnerability.

This objective will be achieved by strengthening the provision of equipment, infrastructure and medical supplies to laboratories and research centers for the early detection and care of patients possibly affected by COVID-19. The following 3 results are expected:

i) Provision of equipment for laboratories and medical staff for the testing of COVID-19.
ii) To design a strategy for the Social Appropriation and Dissemination of Knowledge about COVID-19.
iii) Support for research centers, universities and companies in R&D and innovation projects against COVID-19.

","Acknowledging the current global scenario caused by the Covid-19 and the challenges that it imposes, the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, Mrs. Mabel Torres and her team have proposed two dialogues with experts in the framework of the COVID-19 crisis in Colombia. The goal of these dialogues is to create environments where the actors of the national STI system can meet and actively discuss the issues.

● First Dialogue of Experts

The First Experts' Dialogue took place on March 17, 2020, proposed by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, Mrs. Mabel Torres. Considering that Colombia is well aware of the vulnerability and susceptibility of its population concerning COVID-19 and its need to generate strong, robust and decisive action as a country against the virus's effects, the dialogue seeks to be a space for articulation and active discussion among the actors of the national STI system.

The general purpose of the dialogue was to provide strategic and disruptive elements that will help state institutions strengthen the actions being carried out by the National Health Institute of Colombia, based on the articulation of several actors of the national STI system against COVID-19. The main actors in the first dialogue were the academic sector, public and private institutes (among them the National Health Institute and the Institute for Health Technology Assessment), two delegates from the Indigenous Intercultural Health System, the Academy of Medicine, three experts on artificial intelligence, and the Minister of STI and her team.

This Dialogue was conceived as an environment for extended, reflexive, constructive, opportune and pro-positive conversation among the actors of the national STI system, therefore some guiding questions were formulated taking into account the current scenario of the COVID-19 from a perspective of the tasks, challenges and responsibilities that we have as a country. The guiding questions were:
i) What should be the priority actions for the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation in the framework of COVID-19, aiming at promoting the social appropriation of knowledge in the face of the current Coronavirus pandemic, in order to contribute to its mitigation?
ii) How can the academy and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation support the efforts of the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Health to address the COVID-19 pandemic at the national and regional level?
iii) How does the current juncture allow us to be better equipped in terms of policies, plans and programs as a country, to face contingencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic?
iv) How does the current contingency contribute to the formulation of public STI policy and to strengthening the national STI system?

● Second Dialogue of Experts

The Second Experts' Dialogue was held on March 26, 2020, proposed by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, Mrs. Mabel Torres. The objective was to identify from the differential and territorial approach, and taking into account national and international learning: (i) first, the management of the COVID-19 pandemic; and (ii) second, the challenges for research agendas, useful for the production of evidence, as well as for decision making and public policy formulation.

The main actors in the second dialogue were: 6 experts from the academic sector, including doctors, with specializations in Health Services Management, Public Health, Epidemiology, Molecular Biology and Virology. Two international guests attended, Dr. Oscar Franco, Epidemiologist and Director Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) in Bern, Switzerland, and Edna Martinez, Doctorate in Sociology from the Free University of Berlin. At a national level, guests from the National Planning Department and the Director of Emergencies and Disasters Ministry of Health and Social Protection also attended.

There was an introductory context on socio-cultural and political phenomena that may influence the response to the COVID-19, during the containment and mitigation phase. Then, each panelists presented from their perspective the current and future challenges in the field of research in aspects of public health, health service provision, social protection interventions, or in the field of comprehensive social intervention, following their expertise (socio-cultural dynamics, world views, practices and knowledge of indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, migrant population). Likewise, an overview of the international experience allowed for the identification of lessons learned in Europe.

Subsequently, an exchange of ideas and proposals was promoted with the attendees, in order to establish the challenges and responsibilities that correspond to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, as well as those of other sectors or responses that require a sectoral response.

Finally, an analysis of the research challenges or technological or innovation alternatives potentially useful for the contingency was carried out. The guiding questions were:
i) Taking into account territorial differences and social determinants, how should the COVID-19 Pandemic be dealt with?
ii) How do socio-cultural and political dynamics or ethnic characteristics affect the approach to the pandemic?
iii) How can the problems of accessibility and opportunity to provide services and the territorial capacities be overcome with the support of Science, Technology and Innovation?
iv) What alternatives are foreseen for regions with public order problems, migrant population, floating population, for a comprehensive approach to the pandemic?
v) What are the lessons learned and significant experiences that would stand out abroad during the first months? Which should not be repeated?
vi) What would you incorporate as a priority for research or innovation? 
",,"● MinCienciatón

One of the main initiatives taken by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia (with the support of the Colombian Ministry of Health) is the opening of the call MinCienciatón, which is an initiative to confront COVID-19 through the use of the STI. Researchers, innovators, scientists and academics are invited to participate in this call that has a budget of 26 billion COP and seven days to submit proposals through the Ministry's virtual platform. See https://minciencias.gov.co/convocatorias/invitacion-para-presentacion-propuestas/invitacion-presentar-proyectos-que-contribuyan.

Disruptive proposals are expected that will help, for example, the interpretation of data for decision making, and technology that will facilitate the protection of healthcare personnel and patient care in mitigating symptoms. These proposals will be monitored and evaluated by panels of experts who will determine the best ideas. It is important to note that each proposal will have a funding of between 500 million COP and 2 billion COP. With this initiative, it is expected to mobilize more than 500 research groups throughout the country.

The following three modalities are contemplated for the financing of the projects:
i) Public health initiatives related to epidemiological intelligence that will make it possible to plan and act effectively in the event of epidemiological contingencies.
ii) Pre-commercial validation: evaluation of technology prototypes in relevant environments. Projects focused on the pre-commercial validation of new technologies.
iii) Commercial validation: scaling up of technologies for their validation in real operating conditions. Projects focused on the commercial validation of new technologies.

Additionally, the following lines have been established:
i) Public health related to intervention against epidemiological risks associated with COVID-19.
ii) Rapid diagnostic systems for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
iii) Strategies for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and treating COVID-19.
iv) Medical equipment and devices for the management of patients with COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections, ensuring the safety of health professionals.
v) Systems for monitoring real-time data on illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other agents that cause acute respiratory infections, to facilitate decision-making

Lastly, one of the main characteristics of this call is that it is an ad hoc initiative, with rapid processes for the reception and selection of proposals (around 14 days are projected between the time the call is opened and the announcement of the results), which is a novelty for the traditional processes of the calls.

Denmark,2020-03-28 17:04:48.000,"Several agencies under the Danish Ministry of Health employ health professionals and scientific personal (e.g. the medicines agency and the Statens Serum Institut (SSI)). These agencies inform the minister of health, just like they are available for other ministries and agencies. As an example, the SSI participate at every press briefing held by the Danish authorities concerning Covid-19. ","Denmark is a member of several international forums, where action on Covid-19 is coordinated. ","The site Videnskab.dk, which is publicly funded, communicates on science in general, including on Covid-19. Denmark has also launched the site coronasmitte.dk, where all information from Danish public authorities can be found. ","The Danish government has funded research projects, which can help to create new knowledge and new solutions in the fight against Covid-19. In total DKK 50 million has been granted in a fast track model, where the deans of the four faculties of health sciences, the pro-rector of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the academic director of the Statens Serum Institute (SSI) have been asked to submit proposals for Covid-19 related research projects from the researchers at their own institutions.
The whole process took about one week, from call for proposals, to relevant research projects being identified, and funding granted.

Estonia,2020-03-30 09:18:16.000,"On 20 March 2020 the Government Committee tasked with resolving the issues related to events caused by the spread of the COVID-19-causing coronavirus and issues of public health and the economy assembled a scientific advisory board (the Science Council) and confirmed its members. The task of the advisory board is to provide expert information to the Government Committee on the emergency situation. The work of the advisory board is organised by the Government Office and the Ministry of Social Affairs.

Entrepreneurial analytics are prepared and statistical advice is shared in co-operation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Ministry of Financial Affairs, Government Office, Estonian Tax Board, KredEx, Enterprise Estonia, and Statistics Estonia.","The head of the Government Committee on the emergency situation, the Prime Minister, meets regularly with his counterparts across Europe. Also, other Ministers have regular contact with their counterparts to discuss best practices and possible solutions.","The whole government amplifies the messages of the Science Council formed to address the crisis, and bases all decisions on research-based recommendations. There are parallel information campaigns online and in other forms of media to target different groups in society.

Scientists are actively commenting and giving interviews for national media. There are civic society initiatives in social media promoting responsible use of information. ","The Estonian Research Council (ETAg) is coordinating collection of information about the need for new research topics and the capabilities of research performing organizations to do the needed research. 

The quickest way to react is to channel researchers' immediate responses within the framework of existing measures. The planned interventions are divided into short-term fast-line research that provide an up-to-date understanding of the spread of the virus, as well as to help identify the immediate socio-economic effects. This type of research is expected to bring results within a few months. Longer-term research grants are currently being developed – these are more forward looking and will require a longer-term effort.  

Short-term needs are addressed in the framework of the RITA program (see https://www.etag.ee/en/funding/programmes/rita/) through which ETAg has launched an additional call for projects addressing COVID-19. At least two projects (worth approximately 50 000 euros each) will be co-financed (ministries will contribute with 40% of co-financing). Topics will be selected and approved by the scientific advisers of different ministries. The call is open to all R&D institutions. The dedication of more additional funding from structural funds is currently under negotiations with the Ministry of Education and Research.
  
Some of the research groups are working with their international counterparts within existing cooperation networks. 


","An analytics working group, consisting of analysts from the Ministries of Financial Affairs and Economic Affairs, as well as Bank of Estonia, is modelling the outbreak for the Government, and creating economic scenarios and relevant response measures.

The Estonian Research Council has a co-operation platform including the top research managers of research performing organizations. The first meeting for sharing information and discussing possible needed actions and solutions is scheduled for early April. 

The stakeholders are encouraged to submit Covid-19 related applications to the ongoing open call of the funding program ’Nutikas’. The ERDF-funded program supports companies in commissioning necessary applied research or product development projects from universities or research institutions. The aim is to engage private sector to collaborate with research institutions. The additional budget is yet to be fixed.
About the program, see: https://www.etag.ee/en/funding/programmes/nutikas-applied-research-in-smart-specialisation-growth-areas/.","Estonia is participating in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) - such international infrastructures have responded to the pandemic by developing technical solutions to share and coordinate data (genomic, clinical, epidemiological data). Estonian researchers are closely involved in these activities through linked projects.","The Government of Estonia decided to close all educational institutions, except kindergartens, and has applied only digital learning solutions since 16 March. Further information can be found here (incl. FAQ): https://www.hm.ee/en/spread-covid-19-recommendations-educational-institutions. Moreover, Estonian education technology companies have offered their solutions free of charge for the international community to tackle the crisis (see: https://www.hm.ee/en/news/estonia-offers-its-digital-education-solutions-free-support-other-countries).

Estonia put together an online hackathon HackTheCrisis (by Acclererate Estonia) to offer solutions on how to use technology for the crisis response and to deal with the post-crisis era. The action was supported by the Ministry of Economics and Communication. Now HackTheCrisis events run by local communities all over the world are popping up to help solve issues for their communities.

Other initiatives include:
• Salto Growth Camp EMERGE initiative for start-ups;
• Share Force One platform for bringing together jobs and jobless in the situation of rapid entrepreneurial changes;
• Estonian Statistics Board in cooperation with Positium, a private company preparing mobile positioning solutions, are working out a visual showing information about people’s mobility during the epidemic. The solution is designed to show both everyday short range mobility, to visualize for instance the mobility of quarantined persons, and long range mobility, to visualize, for instance, where participants have moved from an event where it is known that infected people have been.
• Non-personalized information about the infected by counties, age and sex is being provided on the Estonian Open Data Platform.

","Less mobility and travelling bring with them more remote studying, working and video conferencing via specialised devices and software; more commercial and government services are moving online, and more digitalisation and automated production is occurring in industry. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is continuously observing, encouraging, coordinating and implementing these developments in the Estonian government and enterprises.","Government support in the form of financial instruments (guarantees and warranties) for enterprises has been declared and is being implemented, as well as support for the workforce (e.g. through withholding taxes and providing direct wage support) – it is expected to support start-up businesses, which are both weakly capitalised and have wages as a relatively high share of costs.

Stimulus packages will be specifically designed to support not only existing enterprises and economic structures, but also to bring along small behavioural changes in entrepreneurial activity towards investments in knowledge-based capital, and future re-structuration and growth.",
European Union,2020-04-01 10:20:47.000,"We will answer this as “informing EU policy and decision-making”:

Science-based guidance is essential. The European Commission launched an Advisory Panel on 17 March 2020 composed of epidemiologists and virologists from different Member States to formulate EU guidelines on science-based and coordinated risk management measures. The panel will be chaired by the Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and co-chaired by Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for health and food safety. The panel will provide advice to the Commission on the following:
• Formulation of response measures to be addressed to all Member States
• Identification and mitigation of significant gaps and inconsistencies in measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including in clinical management and treatment
• Prioritisation of health care, civil protection and other resources as well as support measures to be organised or coordinated at EU level
• Subsequently, recommendation of policy measures for addressing and mitigating long-term consequences of COVID-19.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is closely monitoring this outbreak, providing risk assessments, public health guidance, and advice on response activities to EU Member States and the EU Commission.","The European Commission is coordinating a common European response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Coordination efforts are wide-ranging and take place at the Commission, broader EU, Member State and international levels. The EC is taking resolute action to reinforce our public health sectors and mitigate the socio-economic impact in the European Union. There are active discussions between DG R&I and the R&I DGs of the national administrations to discuss the coordination of R&I actions on COVID19.

The crisis coordination mechanism of the Commission has been activated and the Crisis Coordination Committee meets regularly to synergise the action of all the relevant departments and services of the Commission and of the EU agencies. It is chaired by Commissioner Janez Lenarčič in his role of European Emergency Response Coordinator. The Commission has also established a coordinating response team at political level composed of the commissioners responsible for the most affected policies.

External coordination on the R&I response is ensured mainly through the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R). This is a network of preparedness research funders; the Commission funds its secretariat and is one of the vice chairs. Regular teleconferences are held between chairs and vice chairs of GloPID-R, and also with the World Health Organisation (WHO). The network is keen to create synergies between the different research efforts and avoid duplication.
Furthermore, bilateral talks are being held with those Member States that have indicated that they intend to provide support for Corona virus-related research in order to better understand the destinations being considered for their funding efforts.

Additionally, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), which is an initiative that focuses on vaccine development (the Commission is a financial contributor), is ‘fast forwarding’ a programme of vaccine development against COVID-19, aiming to initiate clinical trials of vaccine candidates and to support the development of hundreds of millions of doses.

The EU is assuming responsibility towards the African continent with insufficient health systems to cope – through the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP).

The President of the European Commission has indicated after G20 that the EU stands ready to organise a pledging conference with focus on vaccine development.

The EU has a leading position on open science and is leading the way internationally by connecting initiatives launched by US (OSTP) and UNESCO Plea.","The Commission is active in the area of citizen outreach and communication: within the EC page for the Coronavirus response (https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en), the Commission has launched a page to inform about all the EU research projects and initiatives to tackle the spread of COVID-19 and preparedness for other outbreaks: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/health-research-and-innovation/coronavirus-research_en

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is closely monitoring this outbreak, providing risk assessments, public health guidance, and advice on response activities to EU Member States and the EU Commission.

On ‘fake news’, the European Commission is helping fight disinformation through a close cooperation with online platforms. The EC is encouraging them to promote authoritative sources, demote content that is fact-checked as false or misleading, and take down illegal content or content that could cause physical harm.

The European Commission has also raised attention to the rise of online scams and unfair practices: on 23 March 2020, Commissioner For Justice and Consumers Didier Reynders wrote to a number of platforms, social media, search engines and market places to require their cooperation in taking down scams from their platforms, following the common position endorsed by the CPC network. On 20 March 2020, the consumer protection (CPC) authorities of the Member States, with the support of the Commission, issued CPC Common Position COVID-19 on the most reported scams and unfair practices in this context. The objective is to ask and help online platform operators to better identify such illegal practices, take them down and prevent similar ones to reappear.
","The Commission is providing direct support for research and innovation:

(i) Supporting new research and innovation
- On 30 January 2020, the Commission launched a call for expressions of interest for research projects advancing knowledge for the clinical and public health response to the COVID-19 epidemic. The deadline for submission was 12 February 2020. Ninety one proposals were received. The initially allocated budget of €10 million was subsequently increased to €47.5 million given the scale of the outbreak and the quality and potential of the research proposals submitted. Such rapid action was possible thanks to the standing budget line for public health emergency research funds included in the annual Work Programmes for health research of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. Following the evaluation of proposals on 25-26 February 2020, 17 research projects were shortlisted for funding. Collectively, they cover comprehensively the wide range of research questions related to this novel virus and the disease it causes. Research foci include the virus and disease dynamics, the development of rapid diagnostics, the exploration of different avenues for the development of therapeutics, and vaccine development.
- In addition, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private partnership between the EU and the pharmaceutical industry (through its association EFPIA), announced on 3 March 2020 a special fast track call for proposals for research projects. The projects should focus primarily on developing treatments and diagnostics to tackle better the current COVID-19 outbreak and increase preparedness for potential future outbreaks. The European Commission funds IMI through Horizon 2020 and will contribute up to €45 million to this call. A commitment of a similar scale is expected from the pharmaceutical industry so that the total investment could reach up to €90 million.  
- Another partnership supported by Horizon 2020, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials (public-public) Partnership (EDCTP2), which focuses on infectious diseases research in sub-Saharan Africa, also has a standing budget line to address public health emergencies and is likewise preparing to launch a call for expressions of interest for research projects to address the pandemic.
- The European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator pilot called on start-up companies and SMEs with technologies and innovations that could assist in the treatment of, testing for, monitoring of, or other aspects of the Corona virus outbreak.
- On 16 March, the Commission offered up to €80 million of financial support to CureVac, a highly innovative vaccine developer from Tübingen, Germany, to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the Coronavirus in Europe. The support would come in the form of an EU guarantee of a currently assessed EIB loan of an identical amount, in the framework of the InnovFin Infectious Disease Finance Facility under Horizon 2020.

(ii) Reorienting already on-going research
Over the course of the past few years, substantial investments have been made via Horizon 2020 in research preparedness projects, specifically in anticipation of this type of public health emergency; these research projects have early on (January) been mobilised to the maximum extent for the COVID-19 response. 
- The project “PREPARE” (EU grant of €24 million) supports the research readiness of primary care providers and hospitals through a large network in 42 European countries. The project is currently in highest-level response mode, which implies the initiation and implementation of clinical research studies on SARS-CoV-2 across Europe.
- The project “European Virus Archive Global” (EU grant of €12.2 million) coordinates a virtual collection of viruses, to be used for e.g. diagnostic purposes; it has already responded to more than 1200 requests, providing access to the necessary material for diagnosing Corona virus infection. 
- Other projects such as “VEO” (on diagnostics and data mining) or “MOOD” (on data mining and epidemic modelling) have only just started (on 1 January 2020) but have immediately refocused on the COVID-19 response.
- Finally, targeted exercises are ongoing to screen currently funded projects on potentially relevant activities, e.g. innovations in the fields of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, specialised isolation units for infected patients, tracking human mobility during epidemics, filtration technology to remove viral material, etc. that may be in the pipeline.

(iii) Speeding up research and achieving tangible societal impact by optimising enabling framework condition
As for data sharing, the newly funded projects will need an infrastructure enabling them to share their data. Discussions have started with the currently funded “RECODID” project (one of its partners being EMBL) to explore how this project can facilitate and provide a common platform for data sharing. We aim for this platform to link with different European research infrastructures (EMBL being one example), to become part of the European Open Science Cloud, and to contribute to the future European Health Data Space.

(iv) Drawing up an R&I Action Plan within the ERA framework
The purpose of this R&I action plan will be to identify first priority R&I work streams for coordinated action between the Commission and the Member States taking action against the Corona virus that can be executed in the next weeks.  It will be a living document and will be updated regularly with additional R&I coordinated actions. It will comprehend aspects linked to creating the ‘framework’ conditions for researchers such as access to data and to research infrastructures, and the coordination of clinical trials, as well as funding opportunities for researchers in different formats, and in a coordinated way.
","Does not apply
","Q1B answers this question in more detail. 
- Overall, Horizon 2020 involves an approach of consortia and/or partnerships for industry, researchers, innovators, to collaborate on R&I responses. This also applies to the projects working on the Covid-19 outbreak.
- Moreover, through the European Research Area (ERA), the EC is also working to align R&I responses at the Member-State level.","•  Specifically in response to COVID-19 the Commission has funded a series of projects with topics that range from improving epidemiology and public health to new treatments and vaccines for the virus, which include producing and sharing data and computational models on the specific virus. 17 projects have already been selected for funding specifically on the virus, while another call is ongoing until end March 2020.

• Additionally, large-scale European Research Infrastructures, such as ELIXIR, bring together primary data, models and other research resources on life sciences (including on COVID-19) across the EU and beyond.

• The Commission explores how swiftly to improve computational power for analysis, as well the storage of and access to COVID-19 raw research data (e.g. genomic data, clinical research data, epidemiological data or high dimensional data) through a European data platform for COVID-19 to be developed by EMBL-EBI, which would allow rapid sharing of research data and other relevant information by the research community and building on existing work by EMBL-EBI. 

• The Commission coordinates the response to COVID-19-related services offered by Research Infrastructures, as well as supports the development of a discovery portal for COVID-19-relevant research outputs (data, publications and other).
","Short-term impacts:
• Some impact on scientific  events (including e.g. health research related conferences), increased workload on health professionals (some impact on their research work) and potential slowdown in clinical trials activity.
• The mobility of human resources in science, technology and innovation is affected (including researchers, scientists, postdocs) but appears limited to some regions. The impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity is thus limited.
• Limited impact is also expected on global innovation networks process industries (incl. energy and resource intensive industries such as chemicals or steel) or materials research organisations.
• Low impact is expected on EU research & innovation projects, as the participation of China in Horizon 2020 is low.

Medium-term impacts:
• A strong decrease in overall mobility across countries and places in the EU occurs, also for researchers and innovators operating outside of restricted areas, and this has a moderate impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity, which is largely based on such mobility.
• Regular postponement and cancellation of scientific events (including health research related conferences), clear overload of health professionals (with a detrimental effect on their research work) and recurrent delays and cancellation in clinical trials. All those are very likely to have a significant impact on scientific developments in the short to the medium run.
• Strong impact on global innovation networks and - depending on how the situation evolves - potential delays and a reduction of activities. China, US & Germany host the world’s largest R&D investor firms that perform R&D activities away from headquarters. Large impact expected on the activities of those R&D investors and on the work in related R&D labs.

Long-term impacts:
• There is a very large estimated loss of total public & private EU R&D investments of -1.3% (€3.9bn) in 2020.
• The mobility of human resources in science, technology and innovation (including visiting researchers, staff exchanges) is marginal or close to zero, focusing only on a very limited set of health professionals that do research. This has a durable negative impact on Europe’s scientific production, breakthroughs and the translation of scientific outcomes into solutions, which will be very hard to reverse over the medium term, as national science capacity is built very progressively.
• The impact of the outbreak on global innovation networks is very strong with particularly hard impact expected on the activities of large R&D investors (which are largely preforming their R&D activities outside of EU headquarters) and on the work in related R&D labs. This is particularly noticeable in countries such as Germany which host many of those large R&D investing companies and labs. Innovation processes will slowdown as employees in R&D labs and testing facilities may have to stay home.
• Among the 4 most affected third countries by COVID-19 (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran), 3 fall within the 20 most active countries in Horizon 2020. The impact of the outbreak under this scenario is larger for Horizon 2020, given that the 4 most affected countries represent 15% of the ongoing participations of the third countries in the programme. Actions under Horizon 2020 that imply networking of research groups will be more impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak.
• All major scientific events get postponed or cancelled (including health research related conferences), the overload of health professionals impedes them from doing any research work, and most clinical trials get cancelled. This scenario has major significant impacts on scientific developments in the medium run.",,"Research & innovation (R&I) play a key role in the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly in provision of quick science driven solutions including better scientific understanding of the virus as well as development of treatments and diagnostics. R&I also provides the technologies that allow for safer and faster tracking of the virus and fast diagnosis.
Health system’s capacities make a difference in terms of response to outbreaks.  Therefore, it is of paramount importance to invest in making national health systems stronger, more resilient and capable of a rapid and integrated response drawing on the latest scientific discoveries, ensuring equal access to healthcare across the EU. Horizon Europe plans to support R&I activities aimed at strengthening health system’s resilience.

In the “post-covid world” we have three scenarios: (1) A return to business as usual? (2) “Normality” with “lessons- learned”? and (3) The dawn of a radically different reality? There are risks and opportunities coming from this crisis. On the one hand, climate transition is at risk, the return of state intervention or of state surveillance, or de-globalisation. On the other hand, the opportunities include the rise of self-organization and collective intelligence, knowledge sharing, social innovation, and a boom in solidarity. All these aspects impact society as well, for instance, in terms of individual freedom, impact of social distancing, the future of mobility, higher demand for transparency, government distrust, change of consumption patterns, among many others. This calls for foresight practices to look into the impacts on societies and the economy."
Finland,2020-03-30 17:42:40.000,,"The Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) is enhancing its monitoring of the financial sector and, in cooperation with European and Finnish authorities, has adopted measures to promote access to funding and the smooth functioning of the markets despite the pandemic. The FIN-FSA confirms, in line with the decisions taken by the European Central Bank, that banks are temporarily exempt from fulfilling certain additional capital and liquidity requirements. This will facilitate credit institutions’ ability to provide funding to non-financial corporations and households and will alleviate the negative economic effects of the pandemic. The Board of the FIN-FSA has started work on an immediate review of the level of capital requirements that are subject to national decision-making. For more, see:

","The government is stressing in all of its communication the scientific base of its Corona actions and encourages citizens to follow its website (https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus) and the website of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) (https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates), which provide up-to-date comprehensive information on the coronavirus. The Government website contains decisions by the Government, information produced by the ministries on the effects of the coronavirus on different administrative sectors as well as topical material on the coronavirus from all ministries.

For general information inquiries on the coronavirus a phone number (with chat function) has been set up. The information service is open on weekdays at 8–21 and Saturdays at 9–15.","Please note that the response to this question is overlapping somewhat with the issues asked in question 6. We often find it difficult to make a difference between the actions and stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy in general and on the innovation system in particular.

1) The Bank of Finland made decisions on 15 March 2020 on measures aimed at alleviating payment difficulties and liquidity shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring access to funding for households and businesses, particularly SMEs. The decisions were prepared in cooperation with the Government and key authorities, and in dialogue with the financial sector. They complement the decisions taken earlier by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) to support favourable liquidity conditions and preserve the smooth provision of credit in the euro area.

The Bank of Finland assesses, in close cooperation with national, European and Nordic authorities, the stability of the financial system and, in particular, developments in financial intermediation. The purpose is to facilitate the ability of credit institutions to provide funding to businesses and households and to mitigate the negative economic impact of the pandemic. The Board of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) has started work on an immediate review of the level of capital requirements that are subject to national decision-making.

In 2009–2018, the Bank of Finland invested in the domestic corporate paper market. This investment activity was discontinued as market volumes shrank, reflecting the decrease in funding needs of businesses. Recent events have weakened the ability of markets to function and increased the funding needs of businesses. The Bank of Finland has therefore decided to restart its activities in the domestic corporate paper markets. The size of the programme was initially EUR 500 million. A few days later, the size of the programme was increased to EUR 1 billion due to huge demand.

2) The Tax Administration will ease the terms of payment arrangements for the time being. If a company has difficulties paying taxes due to the coronavirus situation, it can request a payment arrangement with eased terms starting 25 March 2020. For example, according to the new terms, the first installment of the payment arrangement will fall due in three months after the arrangement has become active, as opposed to just one month.

See: https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/newsroom/corona-situation/

3) The Government decided on 20 March on an extensive package to support companies and to alleviate the negative effects of the coronavirus epidemic (See press release: https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/hallitukselta-mittava-paketti-yritysten-tueksi-finnveran-kautta-10-miljardin-euron-lisarahoitus-yrityksille). 

Organisations operating in the field of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE Group) monitor the effects of the coronavirus on businesses, employment, consumers and security of supply. The Ministry together with other organisations in the MEAE Group, monitors the effects of the coronavirus on business activities, employment and security of supply, and takes the necessary measures to alleviate the negative impacts. All the relevant general information about the coronavirus and the authorities’ actions and responses can be found from the following website: https://tem.fi/en/information-on-coronavirus

In the field of STI, it includes the following: 

3.1) Business Finland (https://www.businessfinland.fi/en/for-finnish-customers/home/)
Business Finland’s grant authorisations will be increased by EUR 150 million to permit immediate business support measures.
On 19 March 2020, Business Finland launched two new financial services to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic. These services are intended for SMEs and midcaps operating in Finland whose business is suffering from the coronavirus situation. Financial services are intended for at least tourism and auxiliary tourism services, creative and performing industries and all sectors where subcontracting chains are affected. The funding is intended for companies to explore and tap into new business opportunities in emergency conditions. The first funding decisions were made immediately on 20 March 2020.

3.2) Finnvera (https://www.finnvera.fi/eng/)
The Government will make additional financing of EUR 10 billion available to businesses through Finnvera. The principal operating model is offering guarantees to banks that grant loans. In addition, the state will increase its coverage of Finnvera’s credit and guarantee losses from 50% to 80%.

3.3) ELY Centres (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) (https://www.ely-keskus.fi/en/web/ely-en/)
ELY Centres’ grant authorisations for business development projects will be increased by EUR 50 million. The additional authorisation will be used to support SMEs particularly in the service sector but also in other sectors as necessary to manage and prevent the effects of the coronavirus.

3.4) VTT – Technical Research Center (https://www.vttresearch.com/en)
VTT is responding to corona virus in various ways, including the following: 

3.4.1 Responding to customer needs in exceptional circumstances
Through active and continuous communication, VTT enables the understanding of customer needs even in exceptional circumstances. All customer meetings have been converted to online meetings. Plans to help clients monitor the progress of their daily experimental work at VTT, for example, have been developed and are being implemented. VTT's new, streamlined website has been launched. In addition, social media and other digital marketing channels are actively used for communication. As an example, VTT utilizes webinars and recordings of VTT researchers' presentations to enable scientific exchange despite the prevailing conditions.

3.4.2 Immediate RTD actions to assist Finnish society during covid-19
During the Corona pandemic, VTT sees opportunities to participate in a joint national effort by leveraging the organization's expertise and available infrastructure. VTT has identified capabilities that would provide immediate national support for the Corona effort, as well as expertise that will bring significant benefits over the next year. Recognized examples include some with immediate effect, some requiring more time and also additional investments.

3.4.3 Measures to mitigate the economic shock and support national competitiveness
VTT has started planning how VTT's research resources can be harnessed to maintain Finland's competitiveness in this exceptional situation. As client assignments fade, VTT's freed up researcher resources can be utilized (subject to an increase in state aid) for strategic themes and projects that benefit Finnish industry and society and revitalize economic growth. VTT has the capability to launch such research projects quickly. The themes will not only address the challenges posed by the corona situation in terms of industrial competitiveness and security of supply, but will also continue to focus on providing solutions to the long-term challenges of carbon neutrality and the circular economy. Innovations related to these themes will also benefit Finland after the immediate corona crisis eased.
","Fast Expert Teams vs. COVID-19: How Finland can avoid paralysis when experts cannot meet F2F?

The Fast Expert Teams initiative was started on March 16th to combine experts from universities, private and public sector organizations and ministries. This is a rapidly growing voluntary pro bono expert network, growing organically and working across professional and organizational borders with various digital tools and platforms to solve various complex problems that ministries are currently struggling with. Expertise is assembled to fit each complex task so that Fast Expert Teams can tackle various problems quickly. The team is led by Professor Kirsimarja Blomqvist (Kirsimarja.blomqvist@lut.fi) from LUT University (Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology).

The Academy of Finland is making available funding for Covid-19 research (3 million euros).  CSC-Center for Scientific Computing gives priority to its computation capacity for national health care organizations.

Ministry of Social Affairs and Health: The Government submitted the first supplementary budget proposal for 2020 to Parliament on 20 March. An additional appropriation of EUR 12.8 million is proposed for the operating expenses of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare for the expenditure arising from the coronavirus. The additional appropriation is intended for purposes such as disseminating information and raising awareness among citizens, for safeguarding the functioning of information systems and for maintaining laboratory capacity.  Altogether, EUR 6 million of the additional appropriation will be allocated to a broad-based research consortium for research into the coronavirus epidemic, in particular for developing rapid diagnostic methods and research into the emergence of immunity and for creating a national monitoring system for it. Of the additional funding allocated to research, EUR 4 million will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.","The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the Finnish institute of Health and Welfare are liaising strongly with the ECDC and WHO. The Finnish R&I sector is working closely together with its European and Global counterparts on the COVID19 to find ways to respond to the epidemic by using and leveraging on the existing collaborations, partnerships and projects (for example funded through the European Commission).  A total of EUR 5 million is proposed for Finland's participation in the research and development of a COVID-19 vaccine: EUR 4 million to CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation) and EUR 1 million to IVI (International Vaccine Institute).","OECD Secretariat additions (30 March 2020):

Additional information:
In June 2013, under the aegis of the Alliance for Life Sciences and Health,* France launched a consortium called REACTing: REsearch and ACTion targeting emerging infectious diseases. This consortium is organized around a steering committee of 15 human and animal health specialists; it is supported by an 8-member scientific committee and methodological centers. REACTing does not target any particular disease, and can intervene in all infectious emergencies. Its field of action is wide, from basic research to the humanities and social sciences, including the environmental sciences, epidemiology and public health. The approach is transversal and multidisciplinary, because health crises are always complex phenomena in their causes as in their effects.

REACTing has multiple objectives:
• Improve the preparation of research in times of inter-crisis (peacetime): governance, preparation of research tools, identification of research priorities, search for funding, and preparation of the ethical and legal aspects essential for anticipation research projects to be built in an emergency.
• Coordinate, finance and set up research projects in times of epidemic crisis: coordination, scientific and strategic priorities, methodological assistance, information for authorities and the general public.
• Help with public decision-making and reaffirm the place of research in the response to health problems, alongside aspects of care, logistics, security and geopolitics.

Germany,2020-04-06 12:48:47.000,"Germany recently changed the German Infection Protection Act that is the legal basis for protective measures against health crises. According to the federalist principle, the German federal states have so far been the competent authority to implement the law. Within the division of responsibilities in Germany’s federal system, in case of a pandemic the German Federation used to have a coordinating role, promoting a unified approach to fighting the pandemic and running public information campaigns, and making recommendations to the federal states. 
However, in order to effectively protect the nation against the spread of the new coronavirus, the federal government has now been given the right to intervene quickly with protective measures, and can also restrict fundamental rights, such as freedom of assembly or freedom of movement. The regulation is limited to one year and will be subject to thorough reevaluation.

Based on the German Federal Government’s pandemic preparedness plan, a crisis task force jointly led by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI) and German Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) gathers all ministry-specific competences for combating the national threat posed by coronavirus (COVID-19).  As well as the BMI and BMG, the task force includes representatives of the German Federal Foreign Office, the German Federal Ministry of Defense, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, the German Federal Ministry of Finance, the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and the German Federal Chancellery. The federal states are involved in the crisis task force through liaison officers or other advisers. 
https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/topics/civil-protection/coronavirus/coronavirus-faqs.html

The Robert Koch Institute, as the leading public health institute in Germany, is continuously monitoring the situation, evaluating all available information, estimating the risk for the population in Germany and providing politicians with recommendations on a daily basis. Information on the novel Coronavirus and hygiene for the general public is available on the website of the German Federal Centre for Health Education https://www.bzga.de/home/bzga/. Additionally, lots of authorities and health insurances have set up hotlines.

","Germany is convinced that each nation will only win the race against this pandemic if we join forces in all areas, including research and development. EU Member States are closely working together and joining forces at EU-level. The European Commission (DG RTD) has collected input from all member states on their R&D activities. The European Commission is also organizing discussions with the ministries of the member states. (We assume that further information will be provided by the EU.) 

Germany is also closely working together with G7 and G20 member states. The recently adopted G7 Leaders’ statement expresses “our conviction that current challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic need a strongly coordinated international approach, based on science and evidence, consistent with our democratic values, and utilizing the strengths of private enterprise.” The G7 “will increase coordinated research efforts, including through voluntary support for the global alliance Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation.  We will support the launch of joint research projects funded by both public and private resources, and the sharing of facilities, towards rapid development, manufacture and distribution of treatments and a vaccine, adhering to the principles of efficacy, safety, and accessibility.”

Germany urges to increase investment in research and development for new vaccines, therapies and diagnostics, to strengthen international cooperation and to follow the recommendations of WHO. Germany, for example, invites G20 countries to also support the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in their effort to develop a vaccine against SARS-Cov2. The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research decided to support CEPI with an additional 140 million € to support R&D on new vaccines against Covid-19.

Germany exchanges information with other international state or philanthropic sponsors under the WHO umbrella in order to achieve the most targeted and coordinated investment possible for the research funds available worldwide. The co-operation with the “Global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness network” (GloPID-R) is most relevant (see: https://www.glopid-r.org/our-work/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/).
","Germany is aware of the need to avoid the dissemination of fake news and through the media and to intensify risk communication for the general public as well as for health care professionals. Therefore, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research has set up a topic page about fake news and the new coronadisease COVID-19. As the virus spreads around the world, Germany is aware of the importance of getting accurate information about the disease. To combat misinformation, the webpage is updated whenever the need arises and this information is spread through social media channels to counteract false information: https://www.bmbf.de/de/faktencheck-zum-coronavirus-11162.html","The German Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) has provided 9,574 Mio. € to support (Federal) Research Institutes in the fight against Corona. The research activities aim at
• Supporting the national fight against the spread of the virus
• The development of vaccines and therapeutics
• Establishing and improving national and international crisis management
• Health education and information for the public and professionals

The institutes receiving support from the German Federal Ministry of Health are:

• Robert Koch Institute (RKI): (i) Expansion and strengthening of the surveillance systems for acute respiratory infections (currently: ICOSARI, GrippeWeb, Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza), establishing an integrated molecular surveillance system and increase of diagnostic capacities. (ii) Establishing and improving national and international crisis management and support of the Federal States in fighting the outbreak. (iii) Education and information for the public and professionals – support of international measures of the RKI (here: African partner institutions and countries).

• Bernhard Nocht Institute on Tropical Medicine (https://www.bnitm.de/en/); Research Center Borstel (https://fz-borstel.de/index.php/en/); Hasso Plattner Institute (https://www.bnitm.de/en/): (i) Measures to develop new infrastructures for diagnosis and development of new anti-virals and therapies against Covid-19; (ii) Research aiming at characterization of SARS-CoV-2 to better understand its spread and properties; and (iii) Providing data on epidemic transmission patterns and diagnostics of proof and resistance of the virus.

• Bernhard Nocht Institute on Tropical Medicine – extra application “international”: Support for the health care system in 12 African countries: Equipment for diagnostic centers, training of lab personnel and capacity building.

• Bernhard Nocht Institute on Tropical Medicine – extra application “Counselling of health professionals”: Establishing a 24 hour counseling service for health professionals to (i) support individual medical decisions/considerations and (ii) prevent decrease in the management of other diseases.
 
The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research launched a Call on Corona on 3rd March 2020. See https://www.gesundheitsforschung-bmbf.de/de/10592.php
(see for English version https://www.dlr.de/pt/Portaldata/45/Resources/Dokumente/GF/2020_03_02_Call_announcement_covid19.pdf). In the meantime, the budget of this Call has been increased to 15 Mio. €. The Call is structured in different modules:
• Module 1 - Combating COVID-19 through early clinical studies for the application of already known therapeutic approaches to Sars-CoV-2
• Module 2 - Control of COVID-19 through new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches
• Module 3 - Research that contributes to the understanding of the virus and its spread
• Module 4 - Support of already ongoing research projects on corona viruses

Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG): On 19th of March 2020, the DFG launched a Call on interdisciplinary research on epidemics and pandemics. Projects will be funded that address prevention, early detection and containment or research on the causes, consequences and handling of epidemics and pandemics looking at SARS-CoV-2 and other human-pathogenic microorganisms and viruses (see: https://www.dfg.de/service/presse/berichte/2020/200318_corona_news/).

Horizon 2020 (European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation): Germany is, for example, taking part in a Marie-Curie-project to overcome the species barriers of coronavirus (see: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/748627); a collaborative project on immunotherapy for rotavirus and coronavirus infections (see: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/748627); and a collaborative European-Chinese project on the diagnosis of coronaviruses using the example of SARS (see: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/3831)

","The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research is funding the development of a research network with 150 Mio. € in order to bundle and strengthen the research activities of German university medicine in the context of the current pandemic crisis. The initiative shall bring together and evaluate the action plans, diagnostic and treatment strategies of all German university clinics. At all university hospitals, the data of the treated COVID-19 patients are also systematically recorded and bundled in a database. In this way, the medical histories or data on the constitution of the patients can be merged. Scientists who are not active in medical research can also gain access to this data collection. Their research will support the work of doctors. The data set will help generate valid and useful knowledge on the individual treatment of patients, pandemic management, but also with regard to vaccine and therapy development. The Federal Government will set up a task force. The task force will coordinate university medicine and politics. Various other scientific networks are also to be included.","The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research decided to support CEPI with an additional 140 Mio. € to support R&D on new vaccines against Covid-19.
The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research is collaborating with other funders under the roof of the WHO in the international funders network GloPID-R (see: https://www.glopid-r.org/ourwork/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/) in order to coordinate investments in research and development. 

The German Federal Ministry of Health will provide WHO with additional financial support of 50 Mio. € for Covid-19. 

The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development will increase measures of German bilateral and regional cooperation with reserve funds to the amount of € 20.82 million and will also examine further possibilities for short-term technical and financial support for the partner countries of German development cooperation. The regional focus is Africa. 
","Given the highly dynamic situation we are currently not aware of specific novel technical approaches.

OECD Secretariat additions (30 March 2020):
The Federal Government co-sponsored a 48-hour virtual Covid-19 hackathon on 20-22 March 2020 (WirVsVirus, https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) aimed at developing solutions to problems related to the Covid-19 crisis (e.g. How to organise neighbourhood assistance through helper platforms? How to track corona-infected, tested and recovered persons?). It had over 40,000 participants that worked on 810 projects organized around 49 themes.","In the short term, there is a need for an “emergency funding for R&I” to fully mobilize, involve and interconnect the available research capacities throughout Germany, Europe and the rest of the world. Evaluation and funding decisions should be fast and the bureaucratic burden of applicants must be minimized. All options for making project funding more flexible are to be used until further notice. The researchers and laboratories as well as the SMEs that are already active in the development of vaccines, drugs, diagnostics and treatment need financial support. If successful, support should be continued in the medium term to advance candidate products through clinical development. Also, immediate sharing of results and more urgently available data is crucial.

In the medium term, the contribution of digitization in the fight against virus pandemics is essential. Supercomputers and big data can effectively improve the simulation of disease spreading or the automatization of the analysis of targets for new drugs and treatments. Preparedness networks, e.g. of researchers, hospitals, clinics and diagnostic laboratories, should receive continuous funding in order to have structures in place to rapidly respond to outbreaks.

In the long term, more basic and bottom-up research in virology end epidemiology is required. Sufficient support for fundamental research in life sciences and biomedicine as well as platform technologies should be mobilized.
","The Federal Government announced several measures to stabilize the economy which are of a historic dimension. The latest information can be found here: https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/coronavirus-1725960

First of all, that package seeks to ease liquidity shortages and help companies of all sizes and sectors to secure their survival, employment and assets. While it is clear that research and innovation continue to be of vital importance for economic growth and recovery, measures geared toward the STI system are identified comprehensively and will be further elaborated shortly.

Greece,2020-03-29 11:25:17.000,"Covid-19 relevant activities are coordinated by an inter-ministerial Committee, headed by the Vice Minister for Civil Protection and Crisis Management. Others participating in the Committee include representatives of the Prime Minister's Cabinet, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Health, the General Secretariat of Civil Protection, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Development and Investments.

As far as scientific advice is concerned, an Expert Committee has been established under the authority of the Ministry of Health, comprising immunologists, epidemiologists, experts on infectious diseases, statisticians and mathematicians.
","Greece participates to the relevant activities and organs of the European Union, the World Health Organization and other international organizations.

The Greek Government has nominated as official representative to the International Organizations for coronavirus issues, Professor Elias Mossialos, (Head of Department of Health Policy and Director of LSE Health at the London School of Economics). 
","Official information and scientific advice to the public is delivered daily from the mass media. Facts, data, scientific information (including alerts on fake news and rumors), measures and recommendations are provided by the Chair of the Expert Committee (see responses to Question 1), Professor Sotiris Tsiodras (University of Athens, Medical School), the representatives of the General Secretariat of Civil Protection, and other representatives of the Greek Government. There is considerable social pressure, raised through social media, to silence divergent opinions contradicting mainstream government policy and proposing different approaches to management of the outbreak. Similarly, the electronic marketing of products promoted as protecting from the virus is socially condemned. Αll the political spectrum stands behind this government action.

Citizens can also get sound information and guidance directly from the National Public Health Organization (Ministry of Health) (https://eody.gov.gr/neos-koronaios-covid-19/) through a 24-hour available phone line. 
","1) Testing for the virus is done by the Hellenic Pasteur Institute (https://www.pasteur.gr), the national COVid-19 Reference Centre. Testing is up until now limited to those with serious symptoms. It is not possible to extend testing to the symptom-free population, mainly due to shortages in reagents and essential consumables. Epidemiological data are stored for all samples. However, it is still early days for concrete epidemiological studies. 

2) Several Greek public Research Centers and Universities have joined forces to contribute to the national effort to broaden testing of the population under an initiative of the National Council for Research & Innovation and the National Public Health Organization. This plan has not been fully implemented yet until all biosafety requirements are met and all controls are completed. As a first phase, the plan includes the Laboratory of Hygiene and Epidemiology of the University of Athens (https://dehems.med.uoa.gr), the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens (https://www.bioacademy.gr/) and the Institute of Applied Biosciences at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (https://www.inab.certh.gr/). Further research entities are also appropriately equipped in order to detect SARS-COV-2 by real time PCR, such as, for example, the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH) (https://www.imbb.forth.gr/). The latter has also developed an innovative technology based on biosensors for the direct detection of virus particles of SARS-COV-2. They are in consultation with the Reference Centre of the Pasteur Institute in order to perform tests. A spin-off company has been created by FORTH for the next steps and exploitation of research results. 

3) There are important research activities in the field of biology of viruses (among them the family of coronaviruses) along with the reaction of the human immune system to viral infections. Such research is mostly undertaken at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology / FORTH, but also at the other biomedical research Institutes. Substantial work is also being done in the field of epidemiological modelling of the virus spread dynamics with mathematical and computer models. 

4) On treatment for COVID-19, Greece is already implementing a strategy of drug-repositioning / re-purposing for already approved drugs. Several research groups along with enterprises are working in this field.
",No specific mechanisms are in place so far. Coordination is under the responsibility of the Inter-ministerial Committee (see answers to question 1).,"At the European level, as for the priorities for EU coordinated R&I action for COVID19, we support the initiatives and actions taken by the European Commission, especially on vaccines and treatment. We welcome the dedicated call of the Health Program with a budget of 47,5 M€. ","1) The Research Centre « Athena » (https://www.athena-innovation.gr/) has developed a web based tool to ease the exploration of COVID-19-related literature, the so-called  “BIP! Finder for COVID-19” (https://bip.covid19.athenarc.gr/), as well as a dataset containing impact metrics and indicators for a set of publications that are related to the COVID-19 infectious disease and the coronavirus that causes it. It is based on the CORD-19 dataset released by the team of Semantic Scholar (https://www.semanticscholar.org/) in response to the ongoing pandemic. The short-term & long-term impact (citation popularity/reading hype & influence, respectively) of the corresponding publications has been calculated using data from the underlying citation network (PMC and OpenCitations COCI) and Mendeley.

2) The Centre of Earth Observation Research and Satellite Remote Sensing of BEYOND of the National Observatory of Athens operates the Web GIS open platform illustrating the daily expansion of COVID-19 at the national and international level (http://webgiscovid19.beyond-eocenter.eu/).

3) Some research teams in Greek Universities (University of Thessaly, University of Thessaloniki) produce by 3-D printing respiratory devices and/or protection material for COVID-19, which are offered to local hospitals.  
","The current global crisis due to coronavirus will have a particularly negative impact both on the public research system and on the companies involved in research projects (mostly SMEs but also several large companies with R&D activities). Most R&D project funding in Greece is provided by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) through the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF). In particular, the beneficiary companies already face severe liquidity problems and will hardly comply with the requirements of the ESIF Regulations in order to receive the installments foreseen in the funding contracts. We believe that the risk of not implementing or not completing the research projects is particularly high and such a development would have disastrous consequences for the businesses themselves, but also for the absorption of the NSRF 2014-20 funds. Consequently, we plan to negotiate an extension of eligibility of expenses of the current programming period up to 2025.

At the administration level we are taking all possible measures to ameliorate the effects of restrictions and closures to our universities, research centres and enterprises. We, therefore, extended all deadlines for submission of proposals for R&I projects as well as those for interim monitoring and completion of running projects, upon request by the coordinators. At the same time we will make every effort to speed up the administrative steps and audits for interim / final reviews of projects and to allow / enable timely payments to the enterprises and research organizations that implement and complete their projects.

Ireland,2020-03-30 18:01:45.000,"Ireland’s Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Mark Ferguson, is participating in a research sub-committee of Ireland’s National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). There are plans to use this group as part of the assessment of the funding calls described elsewhere in this survey, so the projects funded are informed by national priorities and results will feedback into it.","Science Foundation Ireland's (SFI) C19 information portal is tracking relevant international Covid-19 STI responses in order to avoid duplication of effort.

SFI are the national contact point for Ireland on various international working groups, for example, OECD (High risk high gain research of the OECD's Global Science Forum), the Small Advanced Open Economies Initiative, Global Research Council Governing Board, the EU ELIXIR (ESFRI Research Infrastructure for life science data), and are coordinating efforts across these and various other channels.

SFI is in close contact with its international research funding partners such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the US to share information.

The Irish Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Mark Ferguson, shares information with international Chief Scientific Advisors, including that of the UK, Prof. Patrick Vallance. 

Prof. Ferguson’s role as chair of the European Innovation Council (EIC) will also support coordination of Covid-19 STI responses; the EIC has launched a call. 

","Science Foundation Ireland is not aware of a formal arrangement for this. We are communicating information from pre-agreed sources such as the Health Service Executive, Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and WHO.","Research and Innovation, in health, academia and industry, have a significant role to play in the national and global response to COVID-19. Consequently, the Government’s main research and innovation agencies have developed a coordinated Rapid Response Research and Innovation programme to help mitigate and manage the COVID-19 pandemic by unlocking the potential of Irish based researchers and innovators to join the global efforts. This coordinated response is comprised of two complementary strands. Having two focus areas allows for sufficient specialisation and coordination while optimising available resources.

(1) The first focus area targets Health services research; Patient-oriented and clinical research; and Population health research to COVID-19. This is led by the Heath Research Board (HRB) and the Irish Research Council (IRC) and details of the call can be found here: https://www.hrb.ie/funding/funding-schemes/all-funding-schemes/grant/covid-19-pandemic-rapid-response-funding-call-cov19-2020/

(2) The second focus area is an agile and adaptive initiative to combine the capabilities of industry and academia in the development of innovative solutions that can have a rapid demonstrable impact on the current COVID-19 crisis in Ireland, including but going beyond the health response to areas such as essential services and supply chains. This is led by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and details of the call can be found here: https://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/covid19-rapid-response/


","Several of the relevant agencies have initiatives in place to connect different actors. One part of Science Foundation Ireland’s (SFI's) 5 point plan for C19 is to connect the different stakeholders. The Health Innovation Hub Ireland has a portal in place to gather information and redirect actors to the right place. Furthermore:

• The two funding schemes mentioned in question 3 (i.e. the Rapid Response Research and Innovation programme) will bring together different STI actors. As part of the SFI, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland call, there is a call to action to come forward: (i) If you have identified a problem where you consider that RD&I could have impact and would like this problem to be highlighted to innovators and researchers, who may be able to advance a solution; and (ii) If you are currently working in an organisation (e.g. in industry, public service, research performing organisation etc.) on a solution that could generate significant impact and strengthen Ireland’s response to the current crisis, and you need to be connected with research experts, government departments or agencies in Ireland that may be able to assist. Here the funders will play a facilitation role in making the connections within Ireland to develop the solutions required. 

• SFI are also developing plans, using existing online platforms, to identify and curate the challenges where research can play a role in solving. These will then feedback into SFI’s existing activities e.g. the Funding Call.

• SFI have also developed a portal of information which will be used to facilitate and encourage collaborations across Ireland and internationally.

","There are no formal international level initiatives at the present time.

Science Foundation Ireland's C19 information portal is tracking relevant international Covid-19 STI responses in order to avoid duplication of effort, to identify areas where Ireland could join international efforts and / or implement similar responses to other countries that are needed in Ireland also.
","Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) expects some of these novel approaches to be deployed as a result of the two funding calls mentioned in question 3.

Italy,2020-03-29 14:09:16.000,"The head of the Civil Protection Department, Angelo Borrelli, established a scientific technical committee to deal with the Covid-19 emergency (Ordinance n. 630 of February 3, 2020). The Committee is composed of:
- Coordinator of the Office for the Promotion and Integration of the National Civil Protection Department, who will act as the coordinator of the scientific technical committee;
- Secretary General of the Ministry of Health;
- Director General of Health Prevention (Ministry of Health);
- Director of the Office for the Coordination of Maritime, Air and Border Health Offices of the Ministry of Health;
- Scientific Director of the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases; 
- President of the National Institute of Health;
- a member designated by the President of the Conference of Regions and Autonomous Provinces.

The Committee advises the Head of the Civil Protection Department on the adoption of the most appropriate prevention measures necessary to deal with the spread of Covid-19 (see http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/amministrazione-trasparente/provvedimenti/dettaglio/-/asset_publisher/default/content/ocdpc-n-630-del-3-febbraio-2020-primi-interventi-urgenti-di-protezione-civile-in-relazione-all-emergenza-relativa-al-rischio-sanitario-connesso-all-in).

","The complexity of the current Covid-19 pandemic crisis requires an exceptional effort by the international scientific community. On March 24, DG-RTD of the European Commission convened a meeting of the Research DGs of the 27 Member States for a first brainstorming on 
(i) priorities for EU coordinated R&I action on Covid-19 in the short (6 months) and medium term (12 months) and beyond; 
(ii) actions to be undertaken by Member States and the European Commission to best maximise funding (e.g. to complement and expand the already launched Covid-19 projects under Horizon2020); and
(iii) how to mobilise State long-term investors.

In this context, Italy proposes to establish a panel of high-level experts which could bridge and co-ordinate the scientific/public health domain with the wider societal domain (something similar to the ‘Mission Boards’), and would allow also scientific efforts and interactions with non-EU countries (e.g. USA, China, etc.) to be better co-ordinated. Furthermore, this ‘board’ could guarantee to have one strategy for COVID-19 (with standardized policies) across countries, also during the crucial post-quarantine phase, in order to ensure that the results obtained during the quarantine/isolation are not nullified.
","The strategy implemented in Italy to tackle the Covid-19 emergency involves an information campaign by the Ministry of Health and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, to make the measures adopted by the government clear to citizens. The daily press conference of the Civil Protection to update the national community on data about the pandemic is broadcast by all main TV networks. Furthermore, in order to reach the largest number of citizens, belonging to a range of different socio-demographic groups, the campaign is being promoted through the main social media networks (Facebook and Instagram), as well as on Italian television channels (private and public). In particular, citizens are warned against fake news. People are invited to rely upon official websites e.g. www.salute.gov.it/nuovocoronavirus.","The Government has kicked off the “Innova per l’Italia: la tecnologia, la ricerca e l’innovazione in campo contro l’emergenza Covid” project (https://innovazione.gov.it/innova-per-l-Italia-la-tecnologia-e-l-innovazione-in-campo-contro-l-emergenza-covid-19/), jointly managed by three Ministries (Innovation, Economic Development, University & Research) targeted at companies, universities, public and private research institutions, who can provide contributions in the field of development and production of devices for the prevention, diagnosis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2, to promote its containment. The project invites these actors to propose their contribution in three areas:
- the procurement, innovation or industrial re-conversion of their technologies and processes, to increase the availability of personal protective equipment (in particular surgical masks) and the production of complex respiratory systems for the treatment of respiratory syndromes (including individual components);
- the procurement of innovative kits or technologies to facilitate the diagnosis of Covid-19;
- technologies and tools for monitoring and prevention of Covid-19.
The proposals received will be evaluated and the Extraordinary Commissioner will activate the necessary steps to implement the approved projects.

The Italian Medicines Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) has also set up a crisis unit for the Covid-19 emergency (www.aifa.gov.it). Its strategy is based on four main areas of action: 
- promoting controlled clinical trials of off-label drugs;
- promoting R&D/access to experimental drugs;
- designing national guidelines for Covid-19 case management, in collaboration with the Civil Protection and Lazzaro Spallanzani Hospital;
- preventing shortage of drugs at the hospital level.

Italy strongly encourages exploitation of the ‘newborn’ European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) for sharing data and best practices according to an Open Science and Open Innovation approach. The GloPID-R project (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/874667) could represent another platform with a similar purpose. 
","See the response to question 3, where the “Innova per l’Italia: la tecnologia, la ricerca e l’innovazione in campo contro l’emergenza Covid” project (https://innovazione.gov.it/innova-per-l-Italia-la-tecnologia-e-l-innovazione-in-campo-contro-l-emergenza-covid-19/), jointly managed by three Ministries (Innovation, Economic Development, University & Research) is described.",See the response to question 1.,"A new project, lead by Italian industries, universities and research infrastructures, has been promoted and funded by the European Commission. The EXSCALATE4CoV (E4CoV) project aims to exploit the most powerful computing resources currently based in Europe to empower smart in-silico drug design, while increasing the accuracy and predictability of Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD). Advanced CADD, in combination with high-throughput biochemical and phenotypic screening, will allow the rapid evaluation of the results and reduce time for discovery of new drugs. E4CoV will select, through virtual screening protocols, the most promising drugs against SARS-Cov-2 from a pool of off-label drugs (> 10,000 drugs). At the same time, the Dompè Tangible Chemical Database (TCDb), comprising >500 billion molecules, will be screened to identify new potential drugs to be tested against Covid-19, thus enhancing the success rate of the virtual screening step. Other European participating institutions will contribute in the domains of bioinformatics (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, SIB), biochemical assays (Fraunhofer IME), phenotypic screenings (KU LEUVEN). Along with homology models, the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IIMCB) and Trieste Synchrotron will determine the crystal structure of the coronavirus functional proteins to further enhance the quality of the in-silico models and to evaluate the structural similarities with other viral proteins. The entire process will allow the rapid identification of active and safe molecules to be further tested in animal models and in clinical trials. The coupling of virtual screening with multiple high throughput biochemical and phenotypic screenings will allow the rapid identification of ‘safe in man’ off-label drugs for immediate treatment of the already infected population. Such massive virtual screening activities need a huge computational resource, therefore the activities will be supported and empowered by three of the most powerful computer centres in Europe, namely CINECA, BSC and JÜLICH. The supercomputing facilities have been extended to the other tier-0 systems in Europe, including the ENI Corporate HPC facility, and will be able to guarantee jointly the best combination of hardware architectures, the required knowledge, and the highest speed-up for the simulations. In addition, INFN (CERN Tier-1 centre) will make available their data sharing and high throughput infrastructure to facilitate products exploitation. The Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases is the eligible centre to test for the proof-of-concept in patients, and many others hospital and polyclinics in Italy and Europe confirmed their commitment to participate to this experimentation and project.","In the short term, we need to reflect on how to improve our foresight activities. Most OECD countries invested in these activities in the past, and designed their STI medium-to-long term initiatives accordingly, but we should recognise that our ability to anticipate troubles looming on the horizon was, at best, inadequate. 

Despite the scourge of SARS, MERS and EBOLA, just to mention the most recent viral disease outbreaks, in the last couple of decades we have been listening to a narrative that communicable diseases were as extinct as dinosaurs, but obviously they are not. Therefore, we should accordingly revise our vision and our priorities for investment.  

To guarantee preparedness worldwide - because we know that there will be other epidemics, but we do not know where they can break out again in the future - we should encourage and incentivise seamless sharing data and best practices worldwide. Italy sees this as one of the priorities for the European Open Science Cloud which is now entering into operation.

Furthermore, we should make use of smart directionality, based on scientific evidence and, hence, on research, in orientating the evolution of our health systems. This evolution, in the recent past, has been characterised by a trend which led to a reduction of hospitalizations per inhabitant on one hand, and, on the other hand, to strengthening large care centres. This concentration process, providing greater quality, competence and cutting-edge technologies, should have been accompanied, in principle, by an enhancement of primary care, to ensure overall care services as close as possible to the citizen. In reality, especially in the case of complex care pathways, and the Covid-19 is a case in point, a significant communication and coordination gap remains between these two settings of care, which can cause, and indeed has caused in the current epidemic, a harmful delay in the early detection of cases, which is crucial for circumscribing a sprouting epidemic. 

In this complex challenge of combining the need to guarantee proximity of the services to the patient and the excellence of the healthcare, a fundamental role can be played by new technologies, that can allow these two perspectives to be reconciled, to improve and simplify the processes of diagnosis and care and, in short, to bring excellence to the patients’ home. 

Therefore, besides the ordinary instruments of the current and future R&I programmes, a step forward would be a ‘one stop shop’, to be co-funded by a multilateral initiative (see e.g. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), with an open-ended list of topics, among which a place should be reserved to the development of technologies aimed at supporting preparedness and resilience of our health systems and increasing social cohesion, through a strong person-centric, smart primary health care.
","The “Cura Italia” Decree (Decree Law March 17, 2020, n. 18) regarding measures to strengthen the National Health Service and economic support for families, workers and businesses during the COVID-19 emergency, has made 400 million Euros available to the Ministry of Economic Development also to support companies to invest in R&D and innovation projects.","The Ministry of University and Research has launched on March 23 a mapping activity, addressed to universities and other public research institutions, to collect information about all ongoing research projects and also on planned projects on SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19. The scope of the initiative is to reduce fragmentation and prevent unnecessary duplication. The deadline to collect data has been set for 27 March."

MEXT has permitted the flexible use of funds for the support of researchers' overseas travel, and has been working to ensure that research exchanges will be promoted as usual after the situation is improved.
In the medium- and long-term, it is expected that private investment for R&D will decrease due to economic recession. Additionally, the needs of providing scientific evidence in order to adequately respond to infectious diseases and the importance of further deepening international cooperation for addressing infectious diseases will grow. It is necessary to establish a framework for sharing knowledge and data on infectious diseases across countries.
",The ongoing support for research and development on COVID -19 is being conducted as a measure against infection.,
Korea,2020-03-28 22:12:01.000,"- The Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) of the Republic of Korea takes int account the opinions of industry experts, academics and researchers in government policies for COVID-19.
- Korea’s disease control and prevention capabilities based on expertise are in full force. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) is led by Director Jung Eun-Kyeong, who holds a doctorate degree in preventive medicine, and more than 70 researchers work for the Korea National Institute of Health (NIH), an affiliated organization of the KCDC.
- Academic societies, including the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, Korean Society for Preventive Medicine and the Korean Society of Clinical Microbiology, formed an academia-wide COVID-19 response council and published statements to convey their opinions to the government and the public. The Special Committee on Biotechnology under the Presidential Advisory Council on Science and Technology (S&T) is also providing expert knowledge through expert meeting on COVID-19 response. An online forum was also held by the Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies, Korean Academy of Science and Technology and the National Research Council of Science & Technology. ","- Korea participated in the weekly ministerial conference call meetings (on March 11, 18 and 25) on STI response for COVID-19, organized by the Office of Science and Technology (OSTP) of the U.S in which 11 to 14 countries participated, and discussed international cooperation measures (e.g. use AI to extract relevant information from open data, measures to share COVID-19 data and research outcomes). 
- During the bilateral ministerial call meeting between Korea and US held on March 6 Korea shared the benchmarking cases of Korea, such as the use of Drive-Thru and Self-diagnosis App and sought ways to cooperate in various fields such as diagnostic technology and vaccine development ","- Korea shares the latest available scientific information in a prompt and transparent manner through official website(ncov.mohw.go.kr) as stipulated in domestic law (Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act) which establishes the public’s right to be informed about the latest developments of and responses to outbreaks and infection control. Korea also mandates the disclosure of the whereabouts, means of transportation, healthcare institutions visited, and contacts of confirmed Covid-19 cases.
- Korea shares the latest information (the number of patients, the number of those of under isolation, the number of diagnostic tests, whereabouts of confirmed cases, etc.) and relevant measures via regular briefing that take place twice a day (by the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters in the morning and the Central Disease Control Headquarters in the afternoon) and the frequent distribution of press release, as well as via websites, SNS channels, and portal sites.
- Korea is also promoting the code of conduct for infection prevention. For example, Korea is distributing customized promotional materials for daycare centers, schools, healthcare institutions, pharmacies, etc., and delivering information through a range of easily accessible media (TV, radio, trains, buses, YouTube channels, etc.). Also, Korea is offering counselling for and receiving reports from the public and healthcare institutions through public health centers and the KCDC call center (☎1339) (15,908 call cases out of 16,557(96.1%) & 483 health care out of 485 (99.9%) handled as of March 25).
- Korea is stringently responding to fake news, which leads to excessive public anxiety and causes confusion in infection control, through the pan-governmental cooperation system that encompasses Korea Communications Commission, the National Police Agency, and the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.
- Regarding COVID-19 media coverage, an expert group is providing review comments and global trend reports.
- The Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology(KRIBB) has opened a portal (http://kobic.re.kr/COVID19) to quickly collect and provide research data and information related to COVID-19 from around the world.
- The Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies, National Academy of Medicine of Korea and the National Research Council of Science & Technology jointly organized an online forum to fact check COVID-19 information on March 12.","- Korea is actively carrying out public-private clinical studies on COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. Korea undertook studies on testing kits, treatment, epidemiological study and vaccine development since February 2020.
- The MSIT supported private companies’ development of COVID-19 testing kits to make rapid testing available as soon as possible. Three of the five companies that developed COVID-19 testing kits received support from the MSIT.
- The MSIT is also supporting the Institute Pasteur Korea and Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology to find a treatment for COVID-19 through repurposing drugs whose safety is verified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
- To help Korean COVID-19 testing companies secure technological competitiveness, the MSIT has formed a research council on medical devices for infectious diseases with government-funded research institutes and hospitals specializing in infectious diseases and medical devices, and is providing necessary technology, equipment and networks.","- The central government is cooperating with local governments to respond to COVID-19 effectively. The Central Disaster Management Headquarters (led by the KCDC director) is responsible for all disease control activities, while the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters (led by the prime minister) is providing a swift government-wide support. As for local governments, the Local Disaster Management Headquarters (managed by local government heads) is taking all infection prevention measures available for COVID-19 response.
- Korea formed a COVID-19 response consultative body (composed of Korean Medical Association, Korean Hospital Association, Korea Dentist Association, Association of Korean Medicine, Korean Nurses Association and Korea Pharmaceutical Association) to share COVID-19 response situations and how the medical and pharmaceutical circles should cooperate and exchange opinions on the medical response in the field.","- Korea is participating in international COVID-19 response by inviting foreign researchers to Korean COVID-19 research projects or joining in international cooperative research projects on COVID-19.
- For example, a clinical research team from the WHO is going to participate in the cohort research led by Korean doctors on the virus’ cycle (infection-exacerbation-recovery).
- The International Vaccine Institute, located in Korea, formed an industry-academia-research institution consortium with Korean universities and biotech companies to develop a DNA vaccine for COVID-19 (GX-19).","-To contain COVID-19 outbreaks, the Korean government has established a support system for quarantine and epidemiological study using big data and ICT. As this system uses smart city technologies, which collect and process large-scale city data, the government can quickly identify and track the locations of confirmed and suspect cases to curb the spread of the virus.
- When MERS-CoV spread in Korea in 2015, Korea amended its Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act to allow using data exceptionally to control and prevent the spread of infectious disease while protecting privacy.  In response to COVID-19, using cloud platforms to collect and analyse data, Korea has efficiently shared information with the KCDC, local governments, telecommunications companies and credit card companies to establish a faster epidemiological investigation system.
- To contain the spread of the virus, Korea supported the development of applications that allow citizens to self-diagnose and civil servants to monitor the health status and locations of citizens who are under self-quarantine.
- Korea has effectively released a limited amount of public masks to prevent the spread of infection among citizens, and shared public information about the public masks in cooperation with private companies to solve purchase inconveniences and concerns. As a result of cooperation with private companies, the relevant application and web service were developed quickly.
- To support small and medium-sized enterprises in teleworking, Korea provides SMEs with subsidies for cloud service fees (2.5 billion KRW) and a smart work pilot project (300 million KRW), while providing free or discounted teleworking-related services by partnering with major Korean software companies.
- In response to the increasing necessity for distance learning following the spread of COVID-19, Korea provided free, zero-rating-based online education to low and middle income students in cooperation with three major telecommunications companies.
- Besides, various AI and data companies in Korea are actively participating to overcome the COVID-19 crisis. Representatively, companies provide GIS-based comprehensive situation map services to provide information on the spread of infection and response information. In addition, by providing AI voice-bot service, it is possible to check the health status of people showing symptoms or those who have contacted infected persons. Also, the companies provide trend information through media traffic data analysis. In addition, cloud companies are carrying out various supports to help small and medium-sized enterprises overcome the COVID-19 crisis, including support for developing COVID-19 related applications, web services, and telecommuting solutions. Healthcare companies such as Seegene, Vuno and JLK Inspection utilize AI technologies to drastically reduce the time for developing diagnostics kits and reading X-ray images. Other companies including Deargen and Arontier use AI technologies in screening for drug repositioning and identifying candidate materials for new drug, which would dramatically reduce the time for developing therapeutics. ","- In the short run, R&D budget for infectious diseases will increase; in the middle to long term, international cooperation for infectious disease response will be strengthened (e.g. sharing of information about infectious disease symptoms, global platform for virus data, joint development of vaccines and treatments, global disease prevention and control system, etc.)
- Korea is implementing measures to reorganize STI system for infectious diseases and periodically check the system, and plans to establish a virus research institute that comprehensively studies viruses to systematically respond to infectious diseases.","In order to recover from the economic damage caused by COVID-19, Korea has established an additional budget of 11.73 trillion KRW, of which 71.5 billion KRW has been budgeted for R&D. Considering the existing emergency response research, the total amount for COVID-19 related R&D is 10.9 billion KRW. Emergency response research is tasked to respond to various unexpected disaster and safety problems. These COVID-19 emergency response research includes rapid diagnosis, re-creation of therapeutics, analysis of unique characteristics of COVID-19, and acquisition of research resources and prediction of spread.","Instead of travel bans or lockdown measures, Korea has actively tested asymptotic and suspected cases to mitigate COVID-19 outbreaks. What made Korea’s approach successful is regulatory flexibility that allowed innovative measures such as emergency approval (limited but prompt approval of production, sale and use of testing kits) and Drive-Thru testing."

They consult directly with doctors and specialists in epidemiology to foresee the advances of the epidemic and the increase in cases across the country to reduce the spread of the disease. ,"The National Council for Science and Technology is working constantly on keeping abreast on the international response to the Covid-19 crisis, including research on the new spread of cures and trials for vaccines. At local level, several efforts are being made with research centres to test those efforts and be prepared for the worst phase of the epidemic. ","Yes, the federal government is informing citizens people every day and several times a day. Information based in facts and statistics are shared about the advances of the epidemic and efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Most of the messages are being led by the Ministry of Health.

",Different ministries such as the Science and Technology Council engage in efforts to learn about the potential cure or vaccine for the virus and find out how different countries are fighting the disease and caring for the sick. The health ministry is constantly updating about the advances of the disease and the new cases. Researchers and technical experts are finding new ways to fight the disease. A company that was born at a research center is proving services to allow test to be performed more promptly and at lower cost.  ,"There are many countries where private individuals offer aid to alleviate the crisis. There plenty of trials that involve two or more countries to test new medicine and new ways of treatment. Researchers worldwide are working along with health companies to test new and old treatments such as interferon, hydroxcloroquine, and else.

Netherlands,2020-04-01 08:30:40.000,"The Dutch RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) is in close contact with the government and part of the Outbreak Management Team. 

The National Crisis Decision-making Manual outlines the powers, responsibilities and core tasks of the main actors within the national crisis structure. This core of this structure consists of the Interdepartmental and the Ministerial Crisis Management Committee:

The Commission, chaired by the Minister of Justice and Security or the Prime Minister, decides (by majority) on all measures and arrangements for a coherent approach in a situation where national security is at stake or in another situation that has or can have a major impact on society

Interdepartmental Crisis Management Committee (ICCb)
This High Official Level Commission (DG) is chaired by the NCTV and advises the MCCb and takes its own decisions if necessary and possible.

Flexible
Experts can attend ICCb and MCCb on invitation. Examples include experts in a specific field or representatives of other governments, government services or (vital) sectors. ICCb and MCCb are supported and advised by an Interdepartmental Coordination Consultation and a multidisciplinary staff that are deployed as needed and are flexibly arranged and composed, for example for the provision of information, image and judgment, advice on specific aspects, crisis communication or parliamentary accountability. ","On an economic field, the responses are coördinated within the EU: the EU takes action with an economic response. ","The Dutch public broadcasting foundation regularly asks experts to tell about COVID-19. Expert information, both from the WHO and scientists, is regularly referred to in newspapers and commercial broadcasting foundations. There seems to be only a small minority of newsmakers busy with misleading information. 
However, it's hard to tell what voices are there below the surface. There is some news about false information, ranging from conspiracy theories to misleading health advice. ","1. A guarantee facility for SME loans (BMKB) is already in place and working – EUR 665 million of an available budget of EUR 765 million, 0.08% of GDP. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has expanded guarantees to a higher guarantee percentage, up to 90% of the credit risk of banks for SMEs that want to take out a loan of EUR 1.5 mln maximum but that do not have the required collateral. This measure was recently expanded for SMEs coping with risks associated with the nitrogen ruling (adopted) and is further expanded to apply to SMEs affected by COVID-19.
2. Businesses can request for a special deferral of payment in income tax, corporate tax, turnover tax, energy tax and wage tax. Temporarily, no penalties for failure to pay taxes (on time) will be imposed. Businesses that already forecast lower profits due to the epidemic can request a reduction of the provisional tax assessment and will be able to pay less initial tax in order to avoid liquidity problems. To avoid immediate liquidity problems, the requirement for a “third expert” will not have to be included in the request immediately (but after two weeks). Moreover, the tax authorities will temporarily decrease the recovery interest rate from 4% to 0.01%. 
5. The so-called GO-regulation, through which SMEs can secure a 50% guarantee from the government on their bank loans and bank guarantees, will be expanded. The maximum ceiling guaranteed will be increased from EUR 400 million tot EUR 1.5 billion and the maximum GO-facility per firm will be increased from EUR 50 million to EUR 150 million. This will enable both small and large  firms to benefit from this policy.
6. In order to support small firms and start-ups with little financial reserves, we will expand the Qredits-programme. Through this program, we expect to support approximately 3000 to 6000 firms by a deferment of payment for a period of a maximum of six months and by giving those firms a discount on their rent payments for the same period. 
7. Agricultural and horticultural SMEs will be supported by temporarily relaxing the guarantee for working capital, which is part of the existing decree Borgstelling MKB-Landbouwkredieten (BL). The decree will ease acute liquidity problems for agricultural and horticultural business who experience those problems due to the COVID-situation. The credit is for a maximum of 2 years.
8. Repayments of Innovation Credit and Early Stage Financing, both subsidies in the form of a credit, can be delayed for six monthts. 
9. Likely, the Dutch Health ministry will do additional investments, together with the science and the economic departments, for Corona-related medicines. 
","Within the topsector policy, different stakeholders are already involved. They thus have a platform to find solutions to Covid-19 and already have applied EUR 5 million. Furthermore, they are making Covid-19 related data publicly available. ","On an European level, Horizon 2020 has also been rescheduled to find COVID-19 related vaccines and medicines. ","As far as today, there are no new initiatives . However, TNO, which is a multidiscliplinary applied research institute, has already started doing extra research, focussed on crisis management tools and medical instruments. ","It is hard to forecast the eventual consequences. On the short run, there are already a few results: 
- less R&D teaken place (best guess, no official data yet, however already firms indicating).
- Clinical trials are harder to do;
- Firms, especially young firms, find it harder to attract venture capital. 
On the longer run, firms might start to do more R&D, as they can put their attention in R&D rather than operational activities. This has been a result of the 2008 financial crisis. It is hard to tell if these results also are valid for this crisis.  
","The stimulus package is aimed primarily at sectors in the economy targeted most - hotels, restaurants, café's, and other freelancers who are no longer able to do their work. Given that it is hard for some young entrepreneurs - especially young innovative start-ups - to show the 'economic damage' done by them. It is currently being debated how and if they can be helped.

OECD Secretariat additions (30 March 2020):
On 2 March 2020, the Health Research Council of New Zealand and the Ministry of Health announced a NZ$3 million (USD 1.8 million) rapid research response fund for projects contributing to global COVID-19 efforts (https://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-events/covid-19-research-funding-opportunities-available-now ). NZ$1 million (USD 0.6 million) will be allocated to projects that can provide responses to the current disease threat in the short term (within 3-6 months), and NZ$2 million (USD 1.2 million) to fund research that strengthens New Zealand’s research capacity and response to emerging infectious disease threats. Proposals are invited from all fields of health and social science. 
",,,,"We are still assessing the impact, particularly on international travel and collaboration, and also as remote working becomes standard.  As of 26/3/02 it was too early to begin considering any widespread measures for the science system.","Currently no, beyond those non-specific measures that might apply to scientists as members of the general population (for example, NZ has legislated for temporary limitations on rent increases and a ban on evictions).",Please note we have only provided brief responses to this survey at this point in time as we consider the priority for those involved with managing the response is to focus on that.  We have therefore not consulted widely within various agencies responsible for managing the COVID response.
Norway,2020-04-08 12:26:54.000,"The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) acts as a national competence institution placed directly under the Ministry of Health and Care Services. The NIPH is responsible for knowledge production and systematic reviews and has infectious disease control among its focus areas. The NIPH has a central role in ensuring that  scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19. https://www.fhi.no/en/  

A growing number of studies and reports are being published on COVID-19 and the pandemic. The NIPH has launched a live map of COVID-19 evidence. The project will help decision makers and researchers navigate the research. The map provides an overview of scientific publications on COVID-19 categorized and parsed into more specific subgroups, providing quick access to specific topic-relevant publications. As a result, the map also identifies research gaps, possibly guiding further research efforts. NIPH's partner at McMaster University, Canada, is making an evidence map of trustworthy guidelines. Literature searches are conducted daily or every other day in PubMed. The searches will be supplemented with material retrieved by searches performed by organizations such as WHO, CDC, and others. https://www.fhi.no/en/qk/systematic-reviews-hta/map/ 

The Ministry of Higher Education and Research has commissioned the Research Council of Norway to suggest measures to alleviate the negative consequences for industry and society. The suggested measures are currently being reviewed. 
","The Research Council of Norway (RCN) is a member of the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R).  GloPID-R is an international network of major research funding organizations with the aim to facilitate a rapid and effective response to infectious disease outbreaks. In response to the emergence of COVID-19, Members of the GloPID-R network, including RCN, immediately coordinated to identify the existing, funded research projects in this area and began launching emergency calls for funding. The RCN emergency call on COVID-19 research is published on GloPID-R website and RCN participates in ongoing coordination and information sharing activities through GloPID-R, which also includes WHO. ","Through its website (fhi.no), The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) provides scientific advise and information to the public. NIPH is a government agency under the Ministry of Health and Care Services. Helsenorge.no is another public website that communicates scientific health advice to the public, including Covid-19. Information about both sites are communicated systematically in order make sure the public get quality assured advice and knowledge about Covid-19.
","1. Measures that have been implemented
The Norwegian Research Council has launched a COVID-19 Emergency Call for funding in order to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The aim is to support research that will enable us to understand and contain the new COVID-19, as well as to improve efficient patient management and public health (national and international) preparedness and response to the current and analogous outbreaks that may come in the future. The call for proposals is based on the recent research priorities defined by the WHO. International collaboration with research groups in other countries, including those funded by GLOPID-R member organisations to foster larger-scale studies, is encouraged. The scope of the proposals may include different topics, including health and economic aspects. The total budget is EUR 2 560 000.

The Research Council also has a large portfolio of ongoing projects on issues in the fields of health, biotechnology and societal issues that may be relevant for COVID-19 as well. In addition, several research institutions and public health authorities (such as the Norwegian Institute of Public Health) conduct research that is relevant for this issue. However, we do not have a complete overview or a list of projects. 

2. Measures under consideration, not yet decided 

The suggested measures encompass the Research Council's project portfolio as well as the different research-performing sectors, particularly related to trade and industry and the institute sector (the independent research institutes). The measures will be discussed with the relevant ministries.

The measures suggested by the Research Council have been divided into six categories: 
1. General measure aimed toward the institute sector (increased basic funding) 
2. General measures aimed toward trade and industry 
3. Measures aimed toward the direct restructuring of businesses 
4. Digitalisation measures and competence-building for digitalisation (""kompetanseløft for digitalisering"")
5. Measures aimed toward real-time research and research for crisis management
6. Other measures (the Norwegian public sector, the consequences for low-income countries) 
In addition to these suggested measures, the Research Council wishes to implement measures related to:
-  funding percentage;
-  the research organisations' own contributions for projects that receive funding; 
- changes to the contract period and other changes to the contract that can in part be carried out within the current funding and partly through increased public funding in order to reduce risk, as well as facilitate the situation for the most vulnerable actors in trade and industry and the institute sector.
 
Furthermore, there is a need for measures aimed toward improving the situation for young researchers (PhD candidates and Postdoctoral fellows) who must stay at home to care for children, thereby being barred from using laboratories and other research infrastructure.

Most of the measures are time-limited, and the budget for the majority of the measures must be distributed across several years as this concerns multiannual centres or research projects.
","Under the auspices of the various ministries and the Research Council of Norway there is substantial interaction and meetings between STI actors (universities, the research institute sector, industry, government, health sector) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19. ","The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is a foundation that takes donations from public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations, to finance independent research projects to develop vaccines against emerging infectious disease (EID). CEPI is headquartered in Oslo, Norway. At the 2017 launch, Nature said, ""It is by far the largest vaccine development initiative ever against viruses that are potential epidemic threats"". In March 2020, CEPI was identified as a ""key player in the race to develop a vaccine"" for the coronavirus. 

The Norwegian government  has recently proposed app. EUR 200 million to CEPI for the period 2020-2030.

In order to find out whether some of the existing medications may work against Covid-19, the WHO recently launched a global megatrial called SOLIDARITY. The coordinator of the is study John-Arne Røttingen, Chief Executive of the Research Council of Norway. According to a WHO press briefing on April 1st, 74 countries have so far joined the study, and more than 200 patients have been enrolled. ",,"The higher education sector, the business sector, the institute sector and other stake holders with different backgrounds, are working strategically to find innovative solutions for communication and cooperation. This new insight will in time change the way we interact.  
","The  Norwegian government has presented a set of financial measure to the Norwegian Parliament that includes 2,2 million EUR to business and industry R&D.  These measures are to be decided. 

Upon request from The Ministry of Higher Education and Research, the Research Council of Norway has proposed measures to alleviate the negative consequences for industry and society. This includes a range measures in support of the STI system. The suggested measures are currently being reviewed. ",
Peru,2020-04-14 21:10:24.000,"An advisory board, composed of reputed of epidemiologists, scientists and public health experts has been operating since the beginning of the crisis to inform the policies adopted by the central government. This group of experts reports to the Ministry of Health and its members regularly participate in meetings with the President and the cabinet. This technical team has provided advice in regards to diagnosis tools such as quick and molecular tests, the implementation of quarantine , social isolation schemes, curfews and restricted mobility. Since we are facing an evolving crisis, said instance is constantly analyzing the available information for relaying its technical advice to the decision makers.

On the other hand, The COVID-19 operations command has been created to ensure key actors such as the Ministry of Health, The Health Social Security, Private medical clinics, the Police and the Armed Forces follow a common strategy for the sake of tackling the crisis. This operations command is in permanent communication with the group of experts for ensuring scientific advice is translated into policy decisions on a timely basis.
"," Within the framework of the Organization of American States, we are proposing the creation of the inter american network for modelling and emergency situations. The main goal of this proposed network is to build a mechanism of collaboration where researchers from different disciplines (mathematics, statistics, data science, IT, medicine, biology, geophysics, ecology, etc) can contribute with their technical insights to upgrade the capacities of our countries. This will enable member states to share approaches, instruments, models, systems and experiences to enhance the capacity of member states to model and simulate emergency situations such as pandemics and its potential impacts. In the context of the crisis created by the COVID-19, this initiative would allow us to offer science-based advice to our governments for the sake of improving the decision making process.

At the international level we have coordinated STI responses with multiple governments across the globe. As a result of our government’s consultation with the government of the Republic of Korea, the latter has agreed to share clinical data and medical devices with Peru. The government of China has been providing technical assistance and scientific advice, moreover, chinese private companies and local governments have provided equipment required for coping with the crisis. Through the Pan American Health Organization, our government has participated in a virtual roundtable with experts from China where protocols, methods and best practices were shared.

","Based on the recommendations of the group of experts, since the beginning of the crisis, our government has been consistently sharing educational contents, videos, info-graphics in order to counter misleading information. Said contents are shared taping on all available digital resources, such as websites, social networks, TV and SMS. Furthermore, the members of the group of experts are also regularly providing science based advice on TV, Radio and online platforms in order to disseminate proper information, dispel the doubts of the population and comment on the measures taken by government authorities. All ministries and 

On the other hand, The Innovation Platform of the Ministry of Production, Innovate Perú, has launched a contest named InnoVemos - InnovaCovid-19 challenge. This initiative intends to co-finance projects oriented to disseminate information regarding the preparation, reaction and recuperation actions to be conducted within the context of the crisis.  This contest will find innovative solutions focused on the following priorities:
Dissemination of innovative solutions regarding COVID-19 ( before, during and after the crisis)
Dissemination of information in innovative formats
Dissemination in isolated communities and native communities where spanish is not spoken.

There are two categories, namely Editorial contents (Tales, comics, photo books, graphic novels, etc) and Visual arts (Photographic series, illustrations, drawings, among other similar contents). 

 The Peruvian government has also created a mobile app called “El Perú en tus manos” (Peru in your hands) where citizens can conduct a self assessment of their symptoms, find information regarding the areas with presence of infected persons and seek help, in case it was required.

In order to reach our native and indigenous groups, the peruvian government has developed flyers with information regarding COVID-19 in 21 languages, and launched announcements, short radio programs and podcasts in 14 native languages. This communicational effort has been developed being mindful of the cultural context of the target audience and reaches more than 90% of our indigenous population.


","In March 29th,  The National Council of Science, Technology and Technological Innovation, through its National Fund for Science,Technology and Technological Innovation, launched a public call for research initiatives named “Special projects: Responding to COVID-19”. The call intends to create new scientific knowledge, development, innovation and adaptation of technologies, products, mechanisms or new or improved services which could provide fast solutions to the challenges created by the pandemic. 

For this call, we prioritized 5 themes:
Development, adaption and/or validation of detection systems (diagnosis).
Telehealth, mobile health and digital epidemiological vigilance systems. 
Technological and innovation systems
Treatment  (medicines, vaccines)
Epidemiological and social studies.

Given the need of prompt responses to the crisis, we will prioritize projects in an advanced stage of development, high impact innovation concepts and short term response potential in the following areas:

Projects of applied research
Projects of technological development
Projects of technological adaptation.

We have received 600 concept notes, 55% of which were submitted by universities, 29% came from companies, 6% from research or innovation institutions and the remaining proposals were submitted by public and private institutions which host research units.

In regards to themes covered by the proposals, 14% corresponds to the development and/or validation of rapid tests used for COVID-19 diagnosis. Another 14% of the proposals were related to the treatment of the virus. 29% of the concept notes corresponds to technological and innovation developments, where medical artifacts such artificial ventilation machines required by intensive care units are required. 27% of the proposals present new developments in telehealth and mobile health, and also digital information systems or health management, while the remaining 16% proposals are related to epidemiological and social studies.

From those  600 proposals, 50 have passed to the second round of the selection process.

For supporting the development of the selected initiatives, an initial amount of 5 million soles will be granted. However,we intend to launch additional funds and launch more calls in the near future. In the following link you will find the details of the call https://www.fondecyt.gob.pe/convocatorias/innovacion-y-transferencia-tecnologica/proyectos-especiales-respuesta-al-covid-19 
","Concretely, through the public call we have launched to boost special projects related to COVID-19, we intend to make a contribution to articulate efforts and agglutinate actors that are developing solutions. For instance, according to our protocols, if we receive two or three proposals from institutions that are working on vaccine development or tests, and said institutions are at similar stages of development, we will provide the funding, ensuring that they join efforts to find the right solution. We are also relying on public-private research and development partnerships, which allow research centers, universities and the armed forces to conduct research together and provide technological solutions.
",,,,,"Given the shortage of medical supplies in the international market, a group of STI experts from the Peruvian Navy and academics from the university sector, have successfully developed the prototype of an artificial ventilation machine. Said prototype has been approved by the Ministry of Health and we expect to produce 100 units in one month, and at least 500 units over the next months. The cost of production of this device is 5,000 USD, considerably less than the alternatives which are hardly found in the international market. Public and private efforts are currently focused on developing local STI solutions that could be made available on the short term for countering the viral outbreak."
Portugal,2020-03-29 22:33:18.000,"There is a permanent National Health Council (Conselho Nacional de Saúde), which includes different stakeholders, with the intervention of local councils and professionals, as well as universities and polytechnics, in addition to representatives appointed by the Permanent Commission for Social Concertation (CPCS), National Ethics Council for the Life Sciences (CNECV) and of the Autonomous Regions, as a way of promoting a culture of transparency and accountability to society. It is an independent government advisory body, composed of 30 members, which will guarantee the participation of the various scientific, social, cultural and economic forces, in the search for broad consensus regarding health policy.”
More specifically a new National Public Health Council (Conselho Nacional de Saúde Publica – CNSP) has been appointed in the beginning of the year, and which has been a primary advising body to the Ministry of Health in current crisis. The CNSP includes 20 members, representing several stakeholders and experts, more directly involved in public health initiatives, in the public, private and social sectors, as well as experts from academia and research sectors.
The recent National Preparedness and Response Plan for new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a strategic tool for preparing and responding to a potential SARS CoV2 epidemic. This plan is based on the guidelines of the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, being the national reference document regarding planning the response to COVID-19.

The novel characteristics of the current crisis, that is almost stopping the whole economy, is, nevertheless, hitting different economic sectors with different degrees. Some thriving sectors in Portugal, such as tourism and restaurants, have come to a sudden standstill, while others have been able to maintain a certain level of economic activity. The initial package of measures, beyond the strictly public health measures, have focused on providing financial support to business firms, through a variety of measures, including some directed to the most hit sectors mentioned above, as well as measures aimed to support employment, workers and families. While measures have not been aimed specifically at the STI system, beyond those referred to above, aimed at supporting STI system's contribution to the response to the COVID-19 crisis, the ongoing process of linking of SMEs, start-ups and the research system with larger corporations in broader collaborative initiatives, promoting open innovation and new spaces of co-creation in order to build stronger knowledge and distributed innovation, is expected to have impacts on the economy and on the STI systems beyond the short-term. Additional measures are expected to be developed throughout the response to the crisis and its different stages.

The research of Russian scientists has been recently published regarding ""Artificial intelligence for the repurposing of approved or investigational drugs against COVID-19"" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339998830_AI_for_the_repurposing_of_approved_or_investigational_drugs_against_COVID-19

Compex ICT systems are being implemented to track locations of COVID-19 cases to control the spreading of the disease.

Some universities and commercial teaching centres are opening their online courses for wider audience free of charge.


","It is difficult to anticipate the impact of COVID-19 crisis on the Russian STI system especially in the medium- and long-term. In the short-term one might expect targeted support of focused research devoted to the development of drugs against the coronovirus infection, as well as the development of new means for testing the COVID-19. Considering the expected slowdown in the global economy, gross R&D expenditures may decrease in the mid-term, especially those performed by the business enterprise sector. On the other hand, we may expect a further increase in the digitalisation of science and the economy as a whole, as well as strengthening of the role of the state. In the mid-term, a revision of STI policy priorities and certain growth of innovation activity (as a result of the search for the opportunities to meet the demand in new economic conditions) might take place. In the long-term, there is a possibility for the development of autonomous production technologies (within the framework of general partial reindustrialisation) and for the robotisation in the service sector.","Policy measures to support SMEs and entrepreneurs have been introduced by the President of Russia on 25 March, 2020:
- SMEs are granted a deferral of all taxes, except VAT, for six months. Micro-enterprises will be given a deferment of insurance payments.
- The size of insurance payments for employees of SMEs should be reduced from 30% to 15% (this will not affect salaries at or below the minimum wage).
- Loans to individual entrepreneurs will be prolonged.
- SMEs affected by the crisis should receive a loan extension of six months.
- A six-month moratorium on filing bankruptcy claims by companies and collecting debts and fines.

South Africa,2020-03-29 15:34:22.000,"The South African Department of Health coordinates national response to COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn engages through Cabinet’s National Command Council for decision-making and coordinating the management of interventions by various institutions and individuals. 

The scientific advice to government take many forms. However, there are two most noticeable ones.  Namely, it goes through formal channels such as the Health Ministerial Advisory Committee whose research subcommittee is chaired by the President of the Medical Research Council. Advice is sought and offered daily. Second, there is a COVID 19 Research and Innovation Group, which is focusing on the scaling up of testing, surveillance and clinical research.   
Given that COVID-19 is not just a public health matter, it has implications on water, human settlements, economy, employment, agriculture and equality. In this regard, various Science Councils, the Academy of Science of South Africa and the National Advisory Council on Innovation and higher education institutions and individual experts continue to provide scientific advice proactively or at the behest of government.  
South African society is highly engaged.  In this regard, public statements and articles are being published in various media platforms (including conventional media [television, radio, print] and social networks) to inform and help to shape the current and future response to the pandemic.
","The Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) is engaging with international partners at bilateral and multilateral level to establish links and possible partnerships for rapid responses to the pandemic. These engagements include the following:
• The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
South  Africa  will participate in the Virtual Ministerial Dialogue on the role of international cooperation in science and Open Science to combat Covid-19 due to take place on 30 March 2020..  

• African Union (AU) Commission 
South Africa is exploring collaboration with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) to support the operationalization of the African CDC platforms for clearing and sharing research results and scientific information on the fight against the virus. Virtual discussions on the platform among eminent scientists can also contribute to the identification of knowledge gap on the virus that can lead to research topic that network of African researchers can embark on research issues.

• The Southern African Development Community (SADC)
South Africa is exploring to harness the capability of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) Flagships, namely the Southern African Network for Bioscience (SANBIO) and the Southern African Network for Water Centres of Excellence (SANWATCE) to respond to COVID-19.

• International Science Council (ISC)
South  Africa will further support the African Open Science Platform (AOSP) to enable open access and data sharing in support of the fight against COVID-19.

• European Union (EU)
South Africa is planning to join a call for proposals to be issued by the European Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP), by adding funding to enable South African participants to develop Southern African regional networks.  The call will cover topics such as: understanding the history of the infection; improving surveillance capabilities; developing point-of-care diagnostic tests; supporting clinical management of clinical trials for diagnostics and therapeutics; and validation and adoption of serological tests.

• China
Extensive bilateral research and innovation cooperation is being explored.
","• The South African Government has published regulations under the Disaster Management Act 2002 specifically dealing with “fake news” and Covid-19. Under section 11(5) of the regulations, it becomes an offence to publish a statement through any medium with the intention to deceive about Covid-19, anyone’s Covid-19 infection status or government measures to address the pandemic. The penalty is a fine or imprisonment for six months, or both.
• The Department of Health, supported by the entire government communications machinery, has led efforts to raise awareness among the general public around screening and detection, prevention, hygiene control and the importance of social distancing.
• Also, the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) in collaboration with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), embarked on an Immediate public survey via social media to understand SA public's knowledge about COVID-19, how prepared people are to care for themselves and for other and how they feel about it. The purpose is to identify the attitudes and behaviours of key informant groups, i) taxi drivers, ii) religious leaders, iii) traditional leaders, iv) homes for elderly, v) informal tavern owners, vi) CEO's of private companies, vii) health care workers, viii) Medical aid schemes. This will be follow-up with qualitative research.
","• As a first step, the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) has redirected R4 million (€219,000) from some of its projects to research on COVID-19. The Department is supporting local research that will focus on surveillance, therapeutics and understanding the local epidemiology and natural history of the virus. An additional R3 million has been  available from the International Cooperation and Resources (ICR) Funds within DSI for international cooperation.

• Secondly, the Department has availed R12 million for SA testing of drugs for Covid-19 treatment.

• The Technology Innovation Agency (TIA) is also considering to make funds available to fund some diagnostic and sequencing work.

• The DSI is also engaging with the Department of Health, the Medical Research Council, and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority with a view to mobilising funding, reprioritising research strategies and creating an enabling ethical and regulatory framework to facilitate research on the COVID-19 virus.

• Strategies for the management of mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 infections will be considered and prioritised for further development, costing and implementation. The regulatory and ethics research agenda will include the review and approval of ethical and regulatory challenges pertaining to clinical research. The Department will also prioritise surveillance strategies with a view to funding the top priorities.

• Preliminary work on the development of vaccines has started with University of Cape Town (UCT), Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Biovac. Also, the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA) A is currently engaging with other sources of data and modelling groups, refining their assumptions with a view to produce an updated model of the spread of the epidemic over time. 
","• A National Command Council comprising several ministries has been established to implement protocols planned to curb the spread of the virus.  Reporting to it is an  inter- ministerial sub-committee, which has been established to coordinate a national framework for research on COVID-19.  This Committee consists of representatives from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), National Research Foundation, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), and the University of Cape Town (UCT). The overall aim of this sub-committee will be to mobilize funding, prioritise research strategies and create an enabling ethical and regulatory framework to facilitate research. The focus will be to support research that will focus on surveillance, therapeutics and understanding the local epidemiology and natural history of the virus, specifically by mobilising funding, reprioritising research strategies and creating an enabling ethical and regulatory framework to facilitate research on the COVID-19 virus.  This effort will, thus, focus on describing the epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as addressing diagnostic, therapeutic, host and viral factors that may facilitate transmission or protect against infection. Research topics being considered include among others: diagnostic tests; targeted surveillance to establish risk factors among frontline staff for service delivery; trials for the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of health care workers; the identification of antibodies in patients in South Africa who have successfully cleared the infection; and vaccine development.
• To enhance the role of data and evidence in supporting the response to the COVID-19 emergency, a central situational awareness platform is also being established at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to provide a single view of the reality.
","The DSI is participating in several multilateral coordination platforms for facilitated by UNESCO, the OECD, and others.  The Department is also maintaining active contact with its sister ministries across the world and the diplomatic community in South Africa to share information and proactively identify opportunities for cooperation.   A specific focus is on African regional and continental cooperation.","Data science is at the heart of the South African response to Covid-19 drawing on capacities across the science system, e.g. from the astronomy and theoretical physics communities.   The Department of Science and Innovation through the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research has successfully commissioned and finalized the physical set-up of a core situational awareness platform.  Currently, the core of the platform is health data but over time, we intend to integrated the system with other types of data to provide a more robust platform that can provide holistic decision support to the National Command Centre.  A joint CSIR and Department of Health team are hard at work in creating a range of data warehouses including the current geographic spread of the disease, current cases, health vulnerabilities, and location of health and other facilities, amongst others.  Initial visualisations have been completed and these will be continuously enhanced and improved. We thank the team which worked on this system for the efforts and commitments.  Protocols and arrangements are also being facilitated by the DSI to enable the situational awareness platform to draw in information from other sources. This includes the results of the modelling efforts of various modelling teams on a regular basis.  Initial work, led by a team at the University of Pretoria, have also started mobilizing continent-wide networks to build databases on covid-19 cases. Of particular strategic importance for the South African response effort is the situation in our neighbouring countries.  Protocols and improved management arrangements for the facility will be finalized to protect the health and wellness of the core team.  The team has also identified opportunities for accessing key data sets held by the private sector for the explicit purpose of strengthening our situational capacity capabilities. The support of our private sector partners in this regard is crucial.   The situational awareness platform is flexible and dynamic and will be improved and customized based on the prevailing decision support requirements of the National Command Centre.","The situation is fast evolving, thus, it is difficult to predict the exact impact at this time.   However, it is clear the impact on South African economic growth will be significant and science and innovation will have a crucial role to play to boost growth, continuing the fight against poverty, unemployment and inequality.   The Department is currently finalising the Decadal Plan, which will be an implementation framework for its 2019 White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation and which will include the measures to address the Covid-19 impact.","Comprehensive measures to support small, medium, and micro enterprises during this time will also be available to support qualifying actors in the South African National System of Innovation.  Our measures specifically targeting the STI system will be communicated in due course.","Building an evidence base on behavior and perceptions with regard to Covid-19 is an important priority.   Thought the Human Science Research Council (HSRC),  an online survey is conducted to better understand current behaviours and patterns.  As at 27 March 2020, about 2,400 people have responded to the survey. The sample size has increased but a statistician has been commissioned to assess the quality of the responses and data after which analysis can be done.   The public will be kept informed on the outcome of the results of this survey.  The HSRC is also currently pulling together a range of efforts in this space including work specifically focus on rural communities (SAPRIN), social media sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques.   A number of researchers as well as private sector players have expressed a willingness to assist. Follow-ups are being made on how best they can support a national effort. A call has been made to survey companies in the private sector to join hands with government to better understand the behaviours and perceptions of our people.  Through the HSRC a system will be also be introduced of dynamic updates on behavior and perception issues as these will change on an almost daily basis.  The Department continue to update the public on measurers that it will continue to introduce working together with other government departments and social partners."
Spain,2020-04-01 14:34:49.000,"Since March 14th, the Alarm State Managing Board is composed namely by Health, Defense, Home Office and Transportation Ministries. The Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICIN) provides scientific and technical support to the Presidency and to the Managing Board.

Spain throughout the Ministry for Science and Innovation is actively participating in the definition of a common European and international response to COVID-19 in the domain of research and innovation, to accelerate results and joint efforts in order to avoid fragmentation and duplication. 

Spanish research groups actively involved in the European COVID-19 Horizon 2020 Call include: participation in a multidisciplinary network I-MOVE-COVID-19 (ISCIII); modelling projects such as RiPCoN (IRB) and EXSCALATE4CoV (BSC), diagnostic such as CONVAT (CIN2-CSIC); and treatment projects Solnatide (IRB) and MANCO (CNB-CSIC).

Spain participates in established European fora and platforms including the Health Policy Platform and its Health Security Committee, while shows its commitment to participate in a dedicated space on the Health Policy Platform (HPP) for research teams to share information as soon as it will be set up by the EC. 

Spain also has particular interest in setting up a Working Group on Clinical Case Management (including diagnosis; treatment etc.) under the auspices of the Health Security Committee, where Spain asked for the EU wide support in terms of health professionals (https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/preparedness_response/docs/ev_202003252_sr_en.pdf). 

STI priorities, as supported by MICIN, should focus in an EU and international coordinated action on COVID-19 in the short, medium and long term, though in the short-term urgent action is required. In the short term Spain’ priorities include: 
(1) Addition of laboratory testing – strategies, capacities in Member States; 
(2) Digital solutions for healthcare advice and prompt sharing of clinical practices; (3) full open access to research results and research data; 
(4) Additional public funding for research and innovation in COVID-19 both EU and national sources, in full synergy.
(5) Set up a platform to coordinate R&I activities and national, EU and international level including specific areas such as vaccines, clinical trials, treatments as well as mapping of ongoing research activities.
(6) Promote the use of super computing capacities (i.e. Barcelona Supercomputing Center) and shared services at European and international levels.

In addition, different European groups and initiatives are promoting actions to gather information in specific areas of STI and establish common actions to work jointly. For instance in the context of ESFRI (European Forum for Research Infrastructures) a dedicated site will be deployed to open European and National Research Infrastructures to demands of research on COVID-19, specific access calls, activities in place, etc. 

EOSC  (European Open Science Cloud) initiative is implementing different kind of actions to offer services in base the capacities already available to compute and share data to cope with matters related to the Coronavirus, and foresee to coordinate resources and services at European, national and regional level.
Other research specific fora in which Spain actively support EU cooperation include Horizon 2020’ program committees aimed at establishing proper administrative measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the research community (suspending calls; stopping cost and GA administrative procedures; considering a flexible allocation of research funds directly to Covid-19 funds, etc.  

The Ministry for Science and Innovation is participating through Agencia SINC of the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT) in the European Science-Media Hub of the European Parliament to compile a list of reliable information sources, ranging from recognized official international webpages providing daily updates, to data and maps, as well as a selection of resources tailored for reporters and for tackling the spread of disinformation on the topic.","The Spanish government through the Ministry of Health’ web page offers specific information on COVID-19 addressing health professionals, citizens and the press.

The Ministry of Science and Innovation’ web page gathers all relevant information regarding scientific actions taken at national level on COVID-19 including main initiatives and impact in current calls. The Carlos III Institute of Health also provides updates on the epidemiologic data that are made available on this website.

The Royal Decree Law has also included a dedicated CDTI budget line to provide up to 500 M€ in direct support to mid-caps and SMEs throughout partially reimbursable grants, with no need for any financial guarantee or collateral, seeking to facilitate access to capital for ongoing R&I projects or innovations needed to face the COVID 19 consequences. 

The Spanish research against COVID-19 is competitive and will bring results with the purpose to strengthen it in the research for the COVID-19 different measures has been put in Place:

• The Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) which depends on the Ministry of Science and Innovation, has launched the COVID-19 call to finance research projects on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. This call will have 24 million euros available, as approved by Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of 17 March, on extraordinary urgent measures to deal with the economic and social impact of the new coronavirus. With this new resources, the ISCIII, as a health research funding body, will develop an urgent program of aid for projects and programs that aim to generate knowledge about the infection: to analyze and know the biology of the virus; to develop new therapeutic and prophylactic options, including vaccines; to develop an epidemiological surveillance system and to analyze its impact from the point of view of the health services.

Research areas
The initiatives presented, which may be based on projects already under development or be new initiatives, should focus on the following areas:

•  Development of techniques for rapid virological diagnosis of COVID-19, transferable to the industrial field and applicable to health care, with a priority focus on the diagnosis of early stages of infection and the management of severe cases to optimize stratification and health care.
• Clinical, biological and molecular characterization of the disease, with analysis of clinical stages, prognostic stratification and possible complications.
•  Development of innovative therapies, new antiviral, antiseptic and disinfectant molecules against SARS-CoV-2; studies of antiviral resistance and the effectiveness of non-pharmacological, prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.
• Characterization of SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of genetic and antigenic variation of the virus and management of the immune response and virus-host interaction.
• Development of vaccines, analysis of their efficacy and applicability
• Epidemiological surveillance and molecular study of COVID-19, with analysis of the incidence of mortality, morbidity and lethality; study of environmental and social factors of the spread, risk factors and population dynamics of the infection.
• Use of artificial intelligence tools and massive analysis of integrated data oriented to the epidemiological control of the COVID-19.
• Socio-economic impact of the disease: use of primary care resources, general hospital resources and critical care resources.

Research projects must respect the fundamental principles established in the current wording of the Declaration of Helsinki, promulgated by the World Medical Association, in the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, as well as comply with the requirements established in Spanish legislation in the field of biomedical research, personal data protection and bioethics.

In addition, the National Biotechnology Centre (CNB) of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) will receive 4.45 million € for coronavirus research. CSIC is going to promote the development of its current research and advance in protection strategies against SARS-CoV2. CNB is a worldwide pioneer in a method for cloning viruses that allows them to be genetically manipulated to attenuate their virulence and achieve a vaccine. The team led by professors Luis Enjuanes and Isabel Sola is already working on a project to study the mechanisms of pathogenesis of the new coronavirus. 

The CNB project has six objectives: to generate basic tools and experimental models for the development of protection strategies; identification and testing of antiviral compounds for the treatment of SARS-CoV2; development of specific monoclonal antibodies for protection against the infection; development of the next generation of vaccine candidates; molecular, structural and functional characterization, and computer modeling to understand the spread of the new coronavirus.

The ISCIII, the CNB and other research centers have been declared critical health infrastructures and therefore remain fully operational for COVID-19 research.

In the domain of “clinical trials” related with the COVID19 the Spanish Agency for Drugs and Health Products (Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) has authorized two new clinical trials with a new molecule (remdesivir) for patients with severe respiratory disease. The Ministry of Health is also involved in clinical trials with WHO with drugs related to HVI.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation has started to develop agreements with business associations regarding some dimension of the responses. For example, with the telecom operators to guarantee the connectivity in the network, to explore the use of AI tools applied to the personal cell phones to monitor the diffusion of contagious, etc.

The Ministry of Industry has also started negotiations with sectoral business associations that represent to switch current production lines to produce manufacturing health products.

The main initiatives developed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation are already detailed in Q1A. The Ministry of Science and Innovation and Ministry of Industry are also coordinating different innovation initiatives to foster collaboration with the industrial sector in order to provide health and sanitary products and services such as health monitoring apps; respiratory devices; and the elaboration of Individual protection equipment.
","The main initiatives developed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation are already detailed in Q1B.

The Ministry of Science and Innovation has also joined international efforts to ensure open access to scientific publications on COVID-19. Spain has joined the declaration signed by USA, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Portugal, Singapore and the United Kingdom, to promote access to all the information published on the coronavirus pandemic, a key effort to contain SARS-VOC-2 and reduce its impact. The European Commission will also establish that all the publications supported by EU R&I funds should be open access, excepting the rules of commercial publication rights. At the suggestion of Australia, Spain has supported the study of the possibility of also exempting global patent regulation, with the aim of speeding up the licensing and technology transfer processes, in order to manufacture certain products worldwide.

Most of the European groups, committees and initiatives continuing operating during the containment period. Many of them intend to share initiatives put in place and exchange lessons learnt in the different European and third countries in different domains in relation the COVID-19, e.g. in ESFRI context, an exercise has been launched to learn about how national research infrastructures are managing the crisis and what resources are being offered to work in the different aspects related to the health crisis, national delegates (i.e. ministry or funding agencies' public employees) responsible for the RIs policies in their countries gather relevant information from national RIs managers and users.","Different measures have been put in place, in particular in the EOSC framework EOSC Synergy H2020 project that is coordinated by Spain a new COVID19 Galaxy service has been implemented.
https://www.eosc-synergy.eu/covid19-galaxy-service-eosc-synergy/

The service supports researchers who wish to run computational models for modelling and analysing the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The computation is steered via the Galaxy Portal. The platform offers a series of datasets collections, although every user can download its own data:
• All Coronavirus sequences from the China National Centre for Bioinformatics (CNCB) – nearly 40K sequences.
• The collection of 961 2019-NCOV samples from China National Centre for Bioinformatics (CNCB)
• A reference genome of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1, accession number NC_045512.2.
• The collection of 170 SARS-CoV-2 samples from Genebank
• Reference genome indexes for bwa, gatk and bowtie2 for the NC_045512.2 SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1, can be built.
","In the short term, the COVID-19 sanitary crisis is having a dramatic negative impact at the Spanish economy and to the Spanish System for Science and Innovation also. Currently, it has stopped or slowed down the current calls and the administrative procedures. The economic impact will be translated in difficulties to follow the positive investment trends of our systems. More importantly, at the strategic level. Currently Spain is finishing the future Strategy for Science and Innovation and health sector will be part of the main challenges.

At short and medium-term at the economic level. After the economic crisis, while Spain showed a positive path of economic growth it was slowly advancing in terms of investments towards RDI policies. Regarding Research and Innovation (R&I), Spain remains a ‘moderate innovator’ with declining-flat overall performance relative to that of the EU. However, while the central government budget for R&I has been growing slightly since 2013 and the relative level remains very low and with modest intensity of the Spanish Business Expenditure on Research and Development (BERD). Thus, the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis will impact in the recovery public and private investment with, perhaps, a window of opportunity in the health sector due to the strength in the centers, initiatives, groups and projects in the sanitary area.","The Government has started to approve stimulus packages. 

The first one was included in the Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of 17 March, on extraordinary urgent measures to deal with the economic and social impact of the new coronavirus.  The main focus of this first package has been proving loans and soft credit lines for business and reducing the effect of economic and social damage of the containment strategy adopted. As reported in previous questions specific  EUR 30 million new R&D funding was approved and up to 500 million € soft loans for innovation companies was approved for carry on related COVID19 projects.

New stimulus packages are under study.

The main initiatives developed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation are described in Q1A.",The effective coordination of the different STI policies with regions could be a challenge as health policy is a competence of the regions.

Switzerland,2020-03-30 10:18:11.000,"Policymaking requires a broad range of knowledge. To acquire and develop this knowledge, the federal administration carries out or commissions research activities. In view of the diversity of problems, the responsibility of research in government lies with the various specialized offices. In addition, these offices have their own specific networks and commissions to advise them.

In general, the government works closely with research. In the current crisis, the federal government wants to make even greater use of the potential of the Swiss scientific community. A scientific advisory group will answer ad hoc questions to the federal government, if necessary involving other researchers; see Science Advisory Group (SAB) (see Q.6B)

On March 20th, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences issued medical-ethical guidelines for triage in intensive care units. They apply when an emergency occurs with a large number of seriously ill patients and rationing decisions will be necessary.

On behalf of Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) the Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+) has established a virtual platform where Swiss public health scientists provide epidemiological expertise to FOPH.
","The Swiss STI system is already strongly based on cooperation between the various players and is internationally well networked.

Switzerland is involved in the WHO multi-country solidarity trial with several study centers.

Swiss delegates in the Horizon 2020 Program Committees (Health, Innovative Medicine Initiative and Research Infrastructures) are involved in the development of the calls for proposal with specific focus on SARS-CoV-2. Swiss research institutions are contributing to six of the seventeen project funded by Horizon 2020 through the ad-hoc call. Currently researchers are preparing proposals for the ad-hoc call of IMI.

Switzerland is involved in the European Open Science Cloud, which now is discussing the set-up of a European COVID-19 Data platform in close coordination with the WHO. Switzerland will contribute to this platform as soon as more information is available.
","Two times a week, the government provides information at the highest level (Federal Council) at press conferences. This is supplemented by information from experts.

The dialogue between science and society is one of the main tasks of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. Recently, they released a COVID19 related video entitled “What Swiss Scientists want Young People to know”.
","For the description of the comprehensive support package of the federal council, see Q6.B.

In addition, it is worth mentioning the Swiss participation in international clinical trials by Gilead.

Switzerland will contribute to this platform as soon as more information is available.

Many activities of individual organisations are going on. One example: In response to the Covid-19 crisis, EMBL-EBI is offering new services and especially Data Hub resources to the scientists from Member States. The Swiss community has been informed of the possibility and has shown interest in using the new services. The international research organisations in the area of life sciences (EMBL but also others like ELIXIR) have responded to the crisis not only by locking down most of their infrastructure to protect the staff but also by adopting strategies and offering new services in order to contribute to the ongoing research efforts to resolve the crisis.
","Research data under the SNSF Special Call (see Q6.B) must be made available for researchers and authorities worldwide and without delay at the latest at the end of the project (see Q3).

On March 24th Swiss Universities, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries appealed to all publishing houses to remove paywalls on scientific publications supporting by this way the appeal of the International Coalition of Library Consortia (ICOLC). In the current exceptional circumstances, scientific results need to be shared immediately and transparently to bolster the fight against the new virus.

Virtual SSPH+ expert platform (see Q1.A)
","On 16 March, the Federal Council classified the situation in Switzerland as an ""extraordinary situation"" and introduced various restrictive measures that also affect the functioning of the STI system. The institutions concerned are reacting pragmatically to the problems arising in the short term (e.g. extension of submission deadlines).

Researchers involved in Horizon 2020 Projects or preparing for upcoming calls have difficulties fulfilling their research activities on time. Switzerland is involved in the discussions with the European Commission, Member States and Associated Countries on how to support ongoing and future research activities accordingly.
","The Federal Council is currently doing everything to coordinate the various activities and players in the health and research sector as well as to support the economy to help overcome the corona crisis. The main lines of action are:

1) Support of the health system (measures: Improving or ensuring monitoring, health care, infrastructure, prevention)

2) Support for research (measures: Promotion of digital approaches epidemiology and new test methods & vaccines)

a) Expertise and coordination of the research players via a Science Advisory Group (SAB) coordinated with the Federal Office of Public Health and the ad hoc ETH Domain COVID-19 Task Force (https://ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain-covid-19-task-force) as well as universities (swissuniversities) and academies.

b) Special call of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) for research on Covid-19 (call ended on March, 25th). For further details see: http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/programmes/coronavirus/Pages/default.aspx. This is the first time that the SNSF is launching a call for proposals in response to current events.

c) In preparation: Special programme for SARS / Covid-19 research with the aim of developing solutions to combat the pandemic as quickly as possible through research in larger, also collaborative projects (national and international)

3) Support to the economy. On 13 and 20 March, the Federal Council approved a comprehensive package of measures totaling over CHF 40 billion to cushion the economic consequences of the spread of the coronavirus. The measures include, among others:
- Liquidity support for companies
- Extension and simplification of the instrument of short-time work compensation
- Compensation for loss of earnings for self-employed persons

Turkey,2020-04-10 10:02:17.000,"The Coronavirus Science Board, a Health Ministry taskforce dedicated to fight against the outbreak, was established immediately after the outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey. The board is comprised of medical experts mainly focusing on infectious diseases and public health. The Board regularly holds meetings headed by the Minister of Health and gives government scientific advice on measures to tackle the outbreak. The Board created a 'Pandemic Action Plan', which is a document that is updated regularly in line with the recommendations of the scientific board. The Action Plan includes all necessary measures to tackle with the pandemic while mainly focusing on healthcare issues. Plans for healthcare facilities that would serve as quarantine centres, guidelines for relevant operational and organizational plans to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 infection and plans for the stocks of required serums and antiviral drugs are examples to the content of this Action Plan. 

Turkey has also formed a second science board to tackle the social impacts of the measures taken in the fight against the coronavirus. This new board announced recently and it will include experts in the field of psychology, sociology and statistics. The new board will work on future aspects of the process and will ease the life for society and individuals by making suggestions on social life.
","The International Cooperation Department of TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) coordinates STI cooperation for Covid-19 responses.  The Department continues its efforts in order to facilitate and support international collaborative RDI projects in the fight against COVID-19. Turkey is already associated to the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 Programme, within the scope of which calls have just been opened. Researchers and the private sector in Turkey have and express intense interest in joining the international consortia for these RDI projects, which are focused on the spread of the virus, diagnosis and treatment methods; preventive vaccines, community protection and epidemic control. 

Moreover, TÜBİTAK, as part of a more proactive approach, has initiated bilateral and multilateral cooperation actions to support joint RDI projects that will bring together Turkish researchers and researchers from countries with strategic importance in the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, initial contacts have been made with TUBITAK’s counterpart bodies in China, South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Thailand and France.  Calls for joint RDI support will be launched as part of the bilateral cooperation agreements with China and Thailand. 

In addition, TUBITAK plans to launch a multilateral call that is focused on the private sector, in collaboration with Canada, Germany, Austria, Spain, France, the Netherlands and South Korea. The objective of this call will be to improve disease monitoring technologies utilized in personal protective equipment, disinfection materials, diagnostic and test kits and other therapeutics in the COVID-19 pandemic.  
","The most trustworthy information, data and knowledge are provided by the Ministry of Health, and in terms of Covid-19 R&D activities, the most credible information and data are provided by the Covid-19 Web Portal of TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey). The portal has been launched by the Ministry of Industry and Technology with TUBITAK. 

The statistics on COVID-19, are updated daily and shared on the portal. The statistics include current developments, scientific resources, data sets, useful links; as well as the latest scientific developments in clinical studies, methods of prevention and treatment. The national and international calls for RDI projects are also provided on the portal.  Since its launch, within a week, the portal has been visited by approximately 120 thousand people and has reached more than 1 million page views.
","Co-creation Mechanisms to Cope With COVID-19:
- Policy measures in the field of STI are been mainly built upon facilitating co-creation among actors from different institutions and the private sector. Existing competences and research capacity in Turkey have been taken into account and collaborative funding mechanisms have been utilized to reach immediate solutions to tackle COVID-19 infection in the fields of drugs, vaccines, diagnostic kits and intensive care devices. 
- In the area of drugs and vaccines, all relevant actors in Turkey have been gathered and a COVID-19 Technology Platform was created. TÜBİTAK mobilized an existing support mechanism, namely “High Technology Platforms (TUBITAK 1004)” to provide required funding for this initiative. TÜBİTAK funded a bundle of research projects, which are being implemented in accordance with the roadmap and strategic milestones of the COVID-19 Technology Platform.  A common sense of strengths and challenges have been developed by the actors who are involved in this network for co-creating high value-added products to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The roadmap is composed of 15 different projects including biotechnological and chemical drugs and vaccines for SARS-COV-2 virus. The Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Institute of TÜBİTAK has been given the role of coordinating this platform. There are 225 researchers coming from 25 different universities, 8 public bodies and 8 private sector organisations. The roadmap including 15 projects was written in only 10 days thanks to existing research competences in Turkey. All of the projects are planned to be finalized in nine months. 
- There is also a coordination between TÜBİTAK and the Directorate of Health Institutes (TÜSEB). TÜSEB is responsible for supporting clinical trial phases of these projects. Toxicity testing and validation studies in animal models will be accomplished immediately and the results will be transferred to TÜSEB for clinical trials.  

Fast Tracked Support for Private Sector: 
- TÜBİTAK has also provided specific funding opportunities to the private sector in Turkey that has been fast-tracked at this challenging time. TÜBİTAK opened a specific call, namely “Struggling with COVID-19”, dedicated to private sector on 26 March 2020. This call focused on topics such as intensive care devices, diagnostic kits, masks, protective clothing, computing applications for tracing the spread of COVID-19, disinfectant, vaccine and drugs. The call ended on 2 April 2020 and 444 applications were received. All relevant projects will immediately start in April.  

Young Researchers as a crucial part of the Struggle with COVID-19:
- TÜBİTAK has opened a specific scholarship call, namely “STAR- Intern Researcher Fellowship Programme” dedicated to young researchers who are willing to take part in COVID-19 projects. The call will stay open between 8-19 April 2020. This support mechanisms is designed in response to the high demand received from undergraduate, graduate and doctorate students and post-doc researchers to contribute to the national struggle with COVID-19.

Coronathon and Support for Entrepreneurs:
- The Ministry of Industry and Technology together with the private sector organized a Coronathon event for entrepreneurs who have potential to provide technology based solutions for COVID-19 pandemic. This event was held on 21-22 March 2020.  More than 150 projects competed and more than 150 mentors took roles to help entrepreneurs. 
- TÜBİTAK is providing complementary support to the awardees of this Coronathon competition in collaboration with some of the selected Technology Transfer Offices. Technology transfer offices (Boğaziçi University TTO, İTÜ Çekirdek and METU TTO) will use a top-up fund provided by TÜBİTAK in order to support entrepreneurs through their accelerator programs. These technology transfer offices also act as implementing bodies evaluating the business plans of young and innovative candidate entrepreneurs in the Techno-Entrepreneurship Support Program of TÜBİTAK. ","The COVID-19 Technology Platform has been established in the area of drugs and vaccines with the participation of all relevant actors in Turkey. This platform is supported by TÜBİTAK to develop domestic technology based solutions to cope with the COVID-19 infection. This platform constitutes a good example for a co-creation research hub. There are 225 researchers coming from 25 different universities, 8 public bodies and 8 private sector organisations. TÜBİTAK is providing grants to 15 projects, 8 of which are dedicated to drug development, while  the rest are dedicated for development of vaccines for the SARS-COV-2 virus.      ","TUBITAK has initiated bilateral and multilateral cooperation actions to support joint RDI projects with the aim of facilitating scientific collaboration between Turkish researchers and their colleagues in other countries. Joint RDI project calls with China and Thailand are at the stage of mutual agreement on topics; more joint calls are intended with South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands and France. Within the scope of these bilateral calls, research projects that qualify for providing immediate solutions will be supported with a maximum duration of 9-12 months. The collection of project proposals and evaluation procedures will be much more rapid than the conventional agenda of calls; the intention is to start all projects in mid-June 2020.

TUBITAK also plans to launch a multilateral call that focuses on the private sector, in collaboration with Canada, Germany, Austria, Spain, France, the Netherlands and South Korea. The objective of this call will be the improvement of disease monitoring technologies utilized in personal protective equipment, disinfection materials, diagnostic and test kits and other therapeutics in the COVID-19 pandemic. This international call will focus on RDI projects of SMEs and large industrial organizations and the support will be provided for a maximum of 9 months. Intense efforts are being made to open this call at the end of April 2020.  
","TUBITAK’s (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) ULAKBİM (National Academic Network and Information Center) currently provides a ""National Academic Network"" service with a capacity of 140 Gbps as the global Internet connection and European Academic Network (GEANT) connection service to Turkish researchers. In the period of combating COVID-19, researchers' access to information from virtual media has become a key issue. Moreover, with the measures taken for COVID-19, our universities will continue their spring term education as distance/open/digital education, which has resulted in the need to increase internet capacities and bandwidth demands. In order to meet these needs, ULAKNET has been working with the Turkish major telecom company, Türk Telekom, to open new ports on the main backbone circuits, consisting of Ankara, Izmir and Istanbul.  In this context, the capacity of approximately 100 ULAKNET circuits has been increased by an average of 60%. Approximately 160,000 researchers and over 7 million university students;  210 different institutions and sub-units including all public universities, some private universities, National Library, Council for Higher Education benefit from this service. Until now, all the requests from universities in terms of internet capacity increase have been met.
Considering the distance education services provided through cloud services, a significant number of universities currently offer distance education via ULAKBulut. In this sense, a video conferencing system has been established to meet the needs of universities. Additional backbone networks such as the one in İzmir, are planned to be opened soon. ","In the scope of RDI support mechanisms and programs, priority has been given to themes related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Besides the calls published on vaccines, therapies, drug design and biomedical equipment, one of the high technology platforms funded by TUBITAK has been assigned to Covid-19 drug and vaccine development.  Another call will be launched on the socio-economic, societal and industrial effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Deadlines of calls within RDI support programs, scholarship programs, STI human resources development programs, and science and society activities have been postponed. Digital systems for online project proposal evaluation, peer review and panels have been established. It is foreseen that the procedures for support programs will continue digitally until the effects of the pandemic subside. ","The stimulus package for supporting the economy do not have an RDI pillar. However, the budget for public support for RDI has mostly been allocated to Covid-19 RDI activities. ",
United Kingdom,2020-03-31 23:38:43.000,"UK Government decisions both nationally and in the devolved administrations are guided by advice from the Chief Medical Officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and from the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, and from other experts.  

The UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) provides scientific and technical advice to support senior government decision makers during emergencies. SAGE is chaired by the government Chief Scientific Advisor and co-chaired by the government Chief Medical Officer during health-related emergencies (https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage). SAGE is responsible for ensuring that coordinated scientific advice is provided to Ministers in the Government emergency committee (COBR). 

SAGE advice is fed into COBR through the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, alongside advice on the social, economic, operational and policy considerations. The Government Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Medical Officer attend COBR as required. SAGE relies on external science advice and on advice from expert groups. During COVID-19 this includes the: New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG); Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) (Department for Health and Social Care); Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B).

UKRI is continuing significant discussions across industry, government, and academia to identify new ways to utilise existing research and innovation capabilities to tackle the crisis.

On the 31st March UKRI launched a website to invite the submission of proposals for short term projects addressing and mitigating the health, social, economic and environmental impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. There is no closing date – proposals can be submitted at any time. UKRI will support excellent proposals of up to 18 months duration which meet at least one of the following:
• New research or innovation with a clear impact pathway that has the potential (within the period of the award) to deliver a significant contribution to the understanding of, and response to, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts.
• Supports the manufacture and/or wide scale adoption of an intervention with significant potential.
• Gathers critical data and resources quickly for future research use.
","The UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) provides scientific and technical advice to support senior government decision makers during emergencies.
SAGE relies on external science advice and on advice from expert groups. During COVID-19 this includes the: New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG); Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) (Department for Health and Social Care); and the Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B). These groups consider the scientific evidence and provide their consensus conclusions to SAGE. Their consensus statements have been published. (https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-coronavirus-covid-19-response).
","The Prime Minister has highlighted the need for ongoing international cooperation, particularly through the G20, to share expertise, support the global economic system and strengthen the ability of vulnerable countries to tackle the virus. He has stressed the need to support the WHO’s appeal and support vaccine development through the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

","Minister Amanda Solloway has written (Monday 23 March) to all Higher Education Institutions and other research institutions on the work currently being carried out across the research sector. See https://www.ukri.org/files/news/science-minister-letter-covid19/ 

UK Research and Investment (UKRI) is providing wider advice to researchers and research institutions about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on them and their work. https://www.ukri.org/news/coronavirus-impact-on-ukri-supported-research/

A coordination group involving the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), UKRI, the Department for Education (DfE), the Office for Students (OfS) and others to gather evidence and intelligence on the financial and delivery impact on research of the pandemic.

","On 11 March, the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out plans in his annual Budget to increase public R&D investment to £22 billion per year by 2024-25. The government will invest that money in the people, ideas and industries that will cement the UK’s world-leading position in science and technologies ranging from nuclear fusion to electric vehicles and life sciences. This landmark investment is the largest and fastest ever expansion in support of researchers and innovative businesses in the UK, taking direct support for R&D to 0.8% of GDP and placing the UK among the top quarter of OECD nations (see: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents).
In his speech, he said this was part of making the right long-term decisions for the UK’s economic security and prosperity. In the short-term, he said that next year funding will grow by 15%, the fastest year-on-year growth on record (see: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/budget-speech-2020).
","Many issues around the coronavirus response relate to behaviour. During the 2009/10 ‘swine flu’ pandemic, SAGE received advice from a subgroup called the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour and Communications (SPI-B&C). On 13 February 2020, SAGE decided to reconvene this group, limiting its remit to behaviour (SPI-B). SPI-B is not asked to comment, and has not commented, on what interventions are effective or when they should be triggered. Instead, the group is asked to provide advice aimed at anticipating and helping people adhere to interventions that are recommended by medical or epidemiological experts. Participants change depending on the topic under consideration. Input has been received from academic specialists in Health Psychology, Social Psychology, Anthropology and History. Experts from Government departments also attend to provide input and to discuss issues they are facing.
