      <th>What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>On 20 March 2020 the Government Committee tasked with resolving the issues related to events caused by the spread of the COVID-19-causing coronavirus and issues of public health and the economy assembled a scientific advisory board (the Science Council) and confirmed its members. The task of the advisory board is to provide expert information to the Government Committee on the emergency situation. The work of the advisory board is organised by the Government Office and the Ministry of Social Affairs.<br><br>Entrepreneurial analytics is prepared and statistical advice is shared in co-operation with Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Ministry of Financial Affairs, Government Office, Estonian Tax Board, KredEx, Enterprise Estonia, Statistics Estonia.</td>

      <th>In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>

    <tr>
      <th>Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>The whole government amplifies the messages of the formed Science Council, as well as bases all decisions on research-based recommendations. There are parallel information campaigns online and in other forms of media to target different groups in the society.<br><br>Scientists are actively commenting and giving interviews for national media. There are civic society initiatives in social media promoting responsible use of information.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>Estonian Research Council  (ETAg) is coordinating the collection of information  about the need for new research topics and the capabilities of  research performing organizations to do the needed research. <br><br>Immediate response from the researchers is planned within the framework of existing measures as the quickest way to react. The planned interventions are divided into short term fast line research that provide up-tp date understanding of the spread of virus as well as help to identify the immediate socio-economic effects. This type of research is expected to bring results within a few months.  Longer term research grants are currently developed – these are more forward looking and require longer term effort.  <br><br>The short term needs are adressed in the frameworks of RITA program (https://www.etag.ee/en/funding/programmes/rita/) ETAg has launched additional call for project addressing COVID-19. At least two projects (approximately   50 000 euros each) will be co-financed (ministries will contribute with 40% of co-financing). Topics will be selected and approved by scientific advisers of different ministries. Call is open to all R&amp;D institutions. Dedication of more additional funding from structural funds is currently under negotiations with Ministry if Education and Research.<br>  <br>Some of the research groups are working with their international counterparts within existing cooperation networks. <br><br><br></td>

In the beginning of April the first meeting for changing information and discussing possible needed actions and solutions is scheduled. <br>Entrepreneurs  and RPOs are encouraged to apply for the funding instrument Nutikas https://www.etag.ee/en/funding/applied-research-funding/ The support aims to contribute to growth in the research-intensity of the Estonian economy, supporting collaboration between R&amp;D institutions and companies. Furthermore, the support will help to raise the capabilities of R&amp;D institutions to carry out applied research needed for business in smart specialisation growth areas.</td>

      <td>Estonia is participating in EMBL and EOSC -  international infrastructures have responded to the pandemic by developing technical solutions to share and coordinate data (genomic, clinical, epidemiological data). Estonian researchers are closely involved in these activities through the linked projects.</td>

      <th>What novel approaches, if any, is your country using to address the coronavirus crisis (e.g. use of machine learning, open science initiatives boosting access and sharing of data and research results, development and use of prediction models, etc.)?</th>
      <td>The Government of Estonia decided to close all educational institutions, except kindergartens, and has applied only digital learning solutions from Monday, 16 March. Further information can be found here (incl. FAQ): https://www.hm.ee/en/spread-covid-19-recommendations-educational-institutions. Moreover, Estonian education technology companies have offered their solutions free of charge for international community to tackle the crisis (https://www.hm.ee/en/news/estonia-offers-its-digital-education-solutions-free-support-other-countries).<br><br>Estonia put together an online hackathon HackTheCrisis (by Acclererate Estonia) to offer solutions how to use tech for crisis response and deal with the post-crisis era. The action was supported by the Ministry of Economics and Communication. Now HackTheCrisis events ran by local communities all over the world are popping up to help solve issues for their communities.<br><br>Other initiatives:<br>Salto Growth Camp EMERGE initiative for start-ups;<br>Share Force One platform for bringing together jobs and jobless in the situation of rapid entrepreneurial changes;<br>Estonian Statistics Board in cooperation with Positium, a private company preparing mobile positioning solutions, are working out a visual showing information about people’s mobility during the epidemic. Solution is addressed to show both everyday short range mobility, to visualize for instance the mobility of quaranteened persons, and long range mobility, to visualize, for instance, were have participants moved from an event where it is known that infected people have been.<br>Non-personalized information about the infected by counties, age and sex is being provided on the Estonian Open Data Platform.<br></td>

      <td>Less mobility and travelling bring along more remote studying, working and videoconferences via specialised devices and software; more commercial and government services are moving online, and more digitalisation and automated production in the Industry. Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is continuosuly observing, encouraging, coordinating and implementing these developments in Estonian government and enterprises.</td>

      <th>Is support of the STI system part of planned stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy?</th>
      <td>Government support in form of financial instruments (guarantees and warranties) for enterprises has been declared and is being implemented, as well as support for workforce (holding taxes and direct wage support) – it is expected to support start-up businesses, which are both weakly capitalised and have wages as relatively high share of outcome.<br>Stimulus packages will be specifically designed to support not only existing enterprises and economic structure, but also to bring along small behavioural changes in entrepreneurial activity towards investments in knowledge-based capital, future re-structuration and growth.</td>
