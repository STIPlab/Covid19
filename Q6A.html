The impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity is thus limited.<br>• Limited impact is also expected on global innovation networks process industries (incl. energy and resource intensive industries such as chemicals or steel) or materials research organisations.<br>• Low impact is expected on EU research &amp; innovation projects, as the participation of China in Horizon 2020 is low.<br><br>Medium-term impacts:<br>• A strong decrease in overall mobility across countries and places in the EU occurs, also for researchers and innovators operating outside of restricted areas, and this has a moderate impact on Europe’s science and innovation capacity, which is largely based on such mobility.<br>• Regular postponement and cancellation of scientific events (including health research related conferences), clear overload of health professionals (with a detrimental effect on their research work) and recurrent delays and cancellation in clinical trials. All those are very likely to have a significant impact on scientific developments in the short to the medium run.<br>• Strong impact on global innovation networks and - depending on how the situation evolves - potential delays and a reduction of activities. China, US &amp; Germany host the world’s largest R&amp;D investor firms that perform R&amp;D activities away from headquarters. Large impact expected on the activities of those R&amp;D investors and on the work in related R&amp;D labs.<br><br>Long-term impacts:<br>• There is a very large estimated loss of total public &amp; private EU R&amp;D investments of -1.3% (€3.9bn) in 2020.<br>• The mobility of human resources in science, technology and innovation (including visiting researchers, staff exchanges) is marginal or close to zero, focusing only on a very limited set of health professionals that do research. This has a durable negative impact on Europe’s scientific production, breakthroughs and the translation of scientific outcomes into solutions, which will be very hard to reverse over the medium term, as national science capacity is built very progressively.<br>• The impact of the outbreak on global innovation networks is very strong with particularly hard impact expected on the activities of large R&amp;D investors (which are largely preforming their R&amp;D activities outside of EU headquarters) and on the work in related R&amp;D labs. This is particularly noticeable in countries such as Germany which host many of those large R&amp;D investing companies and labs. Innovation processes will slowdown as employees in R&amp;D labs and testing facilities may have to stay home.<br>• Among the 4 most affected third countries by COVID-19 (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran), 3 fall within the 20 most active countries in Horizon 2020. The impact of the outbreak under this scenario is larger for Horizon 2020, given that the 4 most affected countries represent 15% of the ongoing participations of the third countries in the programme. Actions under Horizon 2020 that imply networking of research groups will be more impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak.<br>• All major scientific events get postponed or cancelled (including health research related conferences), the overload of health professionals impedes them from doing any research work, and most clinical trials get cancelled. This scenario has major significant impacts on scientific developments in the medium run.</td>

Evaluation and funding decisions should be fast and the bureaucratic burden of applicants must be minimized. All options for making project funding more flexible are to be used until further notice. The researchers and laboratories as well as the SMEs that are already active in the development of vaccines, drugs, diagnostics and treatment need financial support. If successful, support should be continued in the medium term to advance candidate products through clinical development. Also, immediate sharing of results and more urgently available data is crucial.<br><br>In the medium term, the contribution of digitization in the fight against virus pandemics is essential. Supercomputers and big data can effectively improve the simulation of disease spreading or the automatization of the analysis of targets for new drugs and treatments. Preparedness networks, e.g. of researchers, hospitals, clinics and diagnostic laboratories, should receive continuous funding in order to have structures in place to rapidly respond to outbreaks.<br><br>In the long term, more basic and bottom-up research in virology end epidemiology is required. Sufficient support for fundamental research in life sciences and biomedicine as well as platform technologies should be mobilized.<br></td>

      <td>The current global crisis due to coronavirus will have a particularly negative impact both on the public research system and on the companies involved in research projects (mostly SMEs but also several large companies with R&amp;D activities). Most R&amp;D project funding in Greece is provided by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) through the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF). In particular, the beneficiary companies already face severe liquidity problems and will hardly comply with the requirements of the ESIF Regulations in order to receive the installments foreseen in the funding contracts. We believe that the risk of not implementing or not completing the research projects is particularly high and such a development would have disastrous consequences for the businesses themselves, but also for the absorption of the NSRF 2014-20 funds. Consequently, we plan to negotiate an extension of eligibility of expenses of the current programming period up to 2025.<br><br>At the administration level we are taking all possible measures to ameliorate the effects of restrictions and closures to our universities, research centres and enterprises. We, therefore, extended all deadlines for submission of proposals for R&amp;I projects as well as those for interim monitoring and completion of running projects, upon request by the coordinators. At the same time we will make every effort to speed up the administrative steps and audits for interim / final reviews of projects and to allow / enable timely payments to the enterprises and research organizations that implement and complete their projects. <br></td>

      <td>In the short term, we need to reflect on how to improve our foresight activities. Most OECD countries invested in these activities in the past, and designed their STI medium-to-long term initiatives accordingly, but we should recognise that our ability to anticipate troubles looming on the horizon was, at best, inadequate. <br><br>Despite the scourge of SARS, MERS and EBOLA, just to mention the most recent viral disease outbreaks, in the last couple of decades we have been listening to a narrative that communicable diseases were as extinct as dinosaurs, but obviously they are not. Therefore, we should accordingly revise our vision and our priorities for investment.  <br><br>To guarantee preparedness worldwide - because we know that there will be other epidemics, but we do not know where they can break out again in the future - we should encourage and incentivise seamless sharing data and best practices worldwide. Italy sees this as one of the priorities for the European Open Science Cloud which is now entering into operation.<br><br>Furthermore, we should make use of smart directionality, based on scientific evidence and, hence, on research, in orientating the evolution of our health systems. This evolution, in the recent past, has been characterised by a trend which led to a reduction of hospitalizations per inhabitant on one hand, and, on the other hand, to strengthening large care centres. This concentration process, providing greater quality, competence and cutting-edge technologies, should have been accompanied, in principle, by an enhancement of primary care, to ensure overall care services as close as possible to the citizen. In reality, especially in the case of complex care pathways, and the Covid-19 is a case in point, a significant communication and coordination gap remains between these two settings of care, which can cause, and indeed has caused in the current epidemic, a harmful delay in the early detection of cases, which is crucial for circumscribing a sprouting epidemic. <br><br>In this complex challenge of combining the need to guarantee proximity of the services to the patient and the excellence of the healthcare, a fundamental role can be played by new technologies, that can allow these two perspectives to be reconciled, to improve and simplify the processes of diagnosis and care and, in short, to bring excellence to the patients’ home. <br><br>Therefore, besides the ordinary instruments of the current and future R&amp;I programmes, a step forward would be a ‘one stop shop’, to be co-funded by a multilateral initiative (see e.g. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), with an open-ended list of topics, among which a place should be reserved to the development of technologies aimed at supporting preparedness and resilience of our health systems and increasing social cohesion, through a strong person-centric, smart primary health care.<br></td>

MEXT has permitted the flexible use of funds for the support of researchers&#39; overseas travel, and has been working to ensure that research exchanges will be promoted as usual after the situation is improved.<br>In the medium- and long-term, it is expected that private investment for R&amp;D will decrease due to economic recession. Additionally, the needs of providing scientific evidence in order to adequately respond to infectious diseases and the importance of further deepening international cooperation for addressing infectious diseases will grow.

Considering the expected slowdown in the global economy, gross R&amp;D expenditures may decrease in the mid-term, especially those performed by the business enterprise sector. On the other hand, we may expect a further increase in the digitalisation of science and the economy as a whole, as well as strengthening of the role of the state. In the mid-term, a revision of STI policy priorities and certain growth of innovation activity (as a result of the search for the opportunities to meet the demand in new economic conditions) might take place.

Currently, it has stopped or slowed down the current calls and the administrative procedures. The economic impact will be translated in difficulties to follow the positive investment trends of our systems. More importantly, at the strategic level. Currently Spain is finishing the future Strategy for Science and Innovation and health sector will be part of the main challenges.<br><br>At short and medium-term at the economic level. After the economic crisis, while Spain showed a positive path of economic growth it was slowly advancing in terms of investments towards RDI policies. Regarding Research and Innovation (R&amp;I), Spain remains a ‘moderate innovator’ with declining-flat overall performance relative to that of the EU. However, while the central government budget for R&amp;I has been growing slightly since 2013 and the relative level remains very low and with modest intensity of the Spanish Business Expenditure on Research and Development (BERD). Thus, the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis will impact in the recovery public and private investment with, perhaps, a window of opportunity in the health sector due to the strength in the centers, initiatives, groups and projects in the sanitary area.</td>
