A second call is envisioned in one month&#39;s time, depending on progress of the pandemia. Both calls have a total funding of €1,5 million and are directed to short-term projects (3 month limit duration and funding per project limited to 30k€, focusing on complementing existing initiatives or reallocating existing human resources).<br><a href="https://www.fct.pt/apoios/research4covid19/index.phtml.pt" target="_blank">https://www.fct.pt/apoios/research4covid...</a><br>- An additional research call has been launched, on March 27 with a deadline of May 28, in the context of the National Initiative for Digital Competences (INCoDe.2030) – AI 4 COVID-19 – Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in Public Administration to strengthen the fight to COVID-19 and future pandemias. These projects require the partnership of research institutes with public administration entities, and must be in line with the National Plan for the Preparation and Response to the Disease by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from the Directorate-General for Health (DGS). The projects are expected to focus on big data, analytic techniques and models, computational resources and products and results.

These include video platform COLIBRI, MOOC platform NAU, EDUCAST and VIDEOCAST.<br>- Legal procedures were put forward to guarantee that all academic evaluation requiring public exams (e.g. PhDs and Habilitation) can be held through the use of videoconferencing and electronic media.<br>- Research fellowships for degree award from FCT have been given a prorogation to account for the disturbances in the work progress due to the current crisis situation. Prorogation of deadlines in ongoing calls have also been implemented in order to support the significant changes brought about by the crisis, as well as the commitment by the health sciences researchers to the ongoing response.

Several HEIs have promoted dedicated sites to gather additional external support. One Associate Laboratory, the Institute for Molecular Medicine (IMM) has already developed an autonomous coronavirus test, which has been recently approved and will contribute to enhance the existing capacity to test infections. Other research institutes are also developing autonomous testing procedures. A fast screening kit and system has been developed by the firm Biosurfit (<a href="https://www.biosurfit.com/en/" target="_blank">https://www.biosurfit.com/en/</a>) with tests in a Hospital in Lisbon;<br>- The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation has set up an Emergency Fund Covid-19 – is a Fund created by Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 5 million Euros initial funding, aiming at strengthening the society resilience to the pandemic in 5 main areas: Health, Science, Civil Society, Education and Culture.  Funding lines considering in the STI area: to tackle the shortage of protection devices and medical equipment, to support early detection and diagnosis, technology based solutions (as platforms and apps), reinforcement of scientific knowledge on 2019 - Covid-19 (vulnerable groups and risk factors, immunity response to the virus, new treatment strategies, new diagnosis methods, involving Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, IGC); support people in need to access distance learning while schools are closed; Bolsas Mais (fellowships for students with less resources applying to university).</td>

The initial package of measures, beyond the strictly public health measures, have focused on providing financial support to business firms, through a variety of measures, including some directed to the most hit sectors mentioned above, as well as measures aimed to support employment, workers and families. While measures have not been aimed specifically at the STI system, beyond those referred to above, aimed at supporting STI system&#39;s contribution to the response to the COVID-19 crisis, the ongoing process of linking of SMEs, start-ups and the research system with larger corporations in broader collaborative initiatives, promoting open innovation and new spaces of co-creation in order to build stronger knowledge and distributed innovation, is expected to have impacts on the economy and on the STI systems beyond the short-term.
