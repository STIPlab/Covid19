It is an independent government advisory body, composed of 30 members, which will guarantee the participation of the various scientific, social, cultural and economic forces, in the search for broad consensus regarding health policy.”<br>More specifically a new National Public Health Council (Conselho Nacional de Saúde Publica – CNSP) has been appointed in the beginning of the year, and which has been a primary advising body to the Ministry of Health in current crisis. The CNSP includes 20 members, representing several stakeholders and experts, more directly involved in public health initiatives, in the public, private and social sectors, as well as experts from academia and research sectors.<br>The recent National Preparedness and Response Plan for new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a strategic tool for preparing and responding to a potential SARS CoV2 epidemic. This plan is based on the guidelines of the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, being the national reference document regarding planning the response to COVID-19.<br><a href="https://www.sns.gov.pt/noticias/2020/03/17/conselho-nacional-de-saude-publica/" target="_blank">https://www.sns.gov.pt/noticias/2020/03/...</a><br></td>

      <th>What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>Several initiatives have been taken in the current short timeframe of the emergence of COVID-19 crisis:<br>- An urgent research call for special projects has been launched to support innovative projects in response to the COVID-19 pandemia - Research 4 Covid-19 – by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) – application between 24 March and 5 April. A second call is envisioned in one month&#39;s time, depending on progress of the pandemia. Both calls have a total funding of €1,5 million and are directed to short-term projects (3 month limit duration and funding per project limited to 30k€, focusing on complementing existing initiatives or reallocating existing human resources).<br><a href="https://www.fct.pt/apoios/research4covid19/index.phtml.pt" target="_blank">https://www.fct.pt/apoios/research4covid...</a><br>- An additional research call has been launched, on March 27 with a deadline of May 28, in the context of the National Initiative for Digital Competences (INCoDe.2030) – AI 4 COVID-19 – Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in Public Administration to strengthen the fight to COVID-19 and future pandemias. These projects require the partnership of research institutes with public administration entities, and must be in line with the National Plan for the Preparation and Response to the Disease by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from the Directorate-General for Health (DGS). The projects are expected to focus on big data, analytic techniques and models, computational resources and products and results. The total funding available is € 3 million, with a maximum funding per project of € 240k and project duration between 24 and 36 months.<br><a href="https://www.fct.pt/apoios/projectos/concursos/datascience/index.phtml.pt" target="_blank">https://www.fct.pt/apoios/projectos/conc...</a><br>- A Call for entrepreneurial ideas has been launched by the National Innovation Agency, ANI, which has already gathered a wide range of technological solutions which have been presented by research centres and innovative firms, on the areas of prevention/diagnostic, treatments, medical and hospital services, home support, business services, teaching/training, work organization and other objectives.<br><a href="https://www.ani.pt/pt/portugal-inovador/portugal-inovador/solu%C3%A7%C3%B5es-covid-19/" target="_blank">https://www.ani.pt/pt/portugal-inovador/...</a><br>- A platform to mobilize researchers - SCIENCE 4 COVID19 – to contribute to responses to the crisis is also being set up.<br>- As a result of the declaration of National State of Emergency, which imposed limitations on mobility and the requirement, when possible for the implementation of teleworking, and the closure of most public services and businesses except essential ones, MCTES determined the essential services in research and academic institutions to be maintained exempt of the limitations, namely those related to research and analysis on COVID-19, infrastructures requiring permanent maintenance, such as medical, veterinary and biological, those related to technological safety, ICT related infrastructural academic resources, social services for higher education students, and basic administrative services to guarantee regular flow of financial support.<br>- Existing resources to support distance learning and teleworking dedicated to the research and higher education system have been increased to respond to the sudden increase in demand, through FCT/FCCN. These include video platform COLIBRI, MOOC platform NAU, EDUCAST and VIDEOCAST.<br>- Legal procedures were put forward to guarantee that all academic evaluation requiring public exams (e.g. PhDs and Habilitation) can be held through the use of videoconferencing and electronic media.<br>- Research fellowships for degree award from FCT have been given a prorogation to account for the disturbances in the work progress due to the current crisis situation. Prorogation of deadlines in ongoing calls have also been implemented in order to support the significant changes brought about by the crisis, as well as the commitment by the health sciences researchers to the ongoing response. Elegibility of expenditure related to cancelled events due to the coronavirus emergency incurred in publicly funded projects has been changed and guaranteed.<br></td>

Several HEIs have promoted dedicated sites to gather additional external support. One Associate Laboratory, the Institute for Molecular Medicine (IMM) has already developed an autonomous coronavirus test, which has been recently approved and will contribute to enhance the existing capacity to test infections. Other research institutes are also developing autonomous testing procedures. A fast screening kit and system has been developed by the firm Biosurfit (<a href="https://www.biosurfit.com/en/" target="_blank">https://www.biosurfit.com/en/</a>) with tests in a Hospital in Lisbon;<br>- The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation has set up an Emergency Fund Covid-19 – is a Fund created by Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 5 million Euros initial funding, aiming at strengthening the society resilience to the pandemic in 5 main areas: Health, Science, Civil Society, Education and Culture.  Funding lines considering in the STI area: to tackle the shortage of protection devices and medical equipment, to support early detection and diagnosis, technology based solutions (as platforms and apps), reinforcement of scientific knowledge on 2019 - Covid-19 (vulnerable groups and risk factors, immunity response to the virus, new treatment strategies, new diagnosis methods, involving Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, IGC); support people in need to access distance learning while schools are closed; Bolsas Mais (fellowships for students with less resources applying to university).</td>

Some thriving sectors in Portugal, such as tourism and restaurants, have come to a sudden standstill, while others have been able to maintain a certain level of economic activity. The initial package of measures, beyond the strictly public health measures, have focused on providing financial support to business firms, through a variety of measures, including some directed to the most hit sectors mentioned above, as well as measures aimed to support employment, workers and families. While measures have not been aimed specifically at the STI system, beyond those referred to above, aimed at supporting STI system&#39;s contribution to the response to the COVID-19 crisis, the ongoing process of linking of SMEs, start-ups and the research system with larger corporations in broader collaborative initiatives, promoting open innovation and new spaces of co-creation in order to build stronger knowledge and distributed innovation, is expected to have impacts on the economy and on the STI systems beyond the short-term.
