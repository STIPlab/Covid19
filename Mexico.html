Also, to find out how different countries are fighting the disease and caring for the sick. Health ministry is constantly updating about the advances of the disease and the new cases. There are some researchers and technical experts that are finding new ways to fight or to improve the chances of the people, i.e. a group of engineers is producing respiratory equipment in 3d printer</td>

      <th>At international level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>There are many countries where high profile people is pouring in aid to alleviate the crisis. There plenty of trials that involve two or more countries to test new medicine and new ways of treatment. Researchers are working along with health companies to test new and old treatments such as interferon, hydroxcloroquine, and else. A trial in Seattle involving volunteers that had the virus was receiving aid and input from researchers across different countries.</td>

      <th>What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>The national Council for Science and Technology is planning to provide resources on research for the disease. Unfortunately most of them are in a long term results scope. in the short term we should see a decrease in activity first for the obligated quarantine but mostly because lack of resources. We should have a long term plan on how to get more information from researchers and turn it into tangible results. That is why the National Council for Science and Technology is pushing for a National Innovation Plan. to be implemented on the medium term.</td>

      <th>Is support of the STI system part of planned stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy?</th>
      <td>Not sure what are the government plans at the moment to alleviate or support the economy. However the National Council for Science and Technology has a short, medium and long term plan to ensure that social and economy benefits come as results of a new Science and Innovation plan. Those benefits take into account input from the civil society, private industry, academia and government with a specific focus on the environment.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>Is there anything else regarding the STI policy response to Covid-19 in your country you would like to mention?</th>
      <td>the lack of a response is outrageous. The federal government, despite what some ministries concerns, seems oblivious to the crisis. They took to long to respond and order a forced quarantine and there is not enough resources at the moment to be prepared to the health crisis approaching rapidly. with the crash of the health system months ago and the lack of preparedness for public procurement, it seems that having access to health care will not be what the crisis calls for. Neither public nor private health systems will have the resources to provide proper care to the ill. Also there is a lack support to those with an informal source of income will not allow for a proper isolation to reduce the spread of the disease</td>
