  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Federal government is in constant communication with experts in health and international crisis. They consult directly with doctors and specialists in epidemiology to foresee the advances of the epidemic and the increase in cases across country to reduce the spread of the disease.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>The National Council for Science and Technology is working constantly on looking at the international response and doing deep research on the new spread of cures and trials for vaccines. At local level, several efforts are being made with research centres to test those efforts and be prepared for the worst phase of the epidemic.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Yes, federal government is updating the people every day and several times a day. Information based in facts and statistics are shared about the advances of the epidemic and efforts made for containment. Most of the messages are being led by the Ministry of Health, others are pertinent to the foreign service. Security is also involved in regards of the guidelines to follow in terms of the quarantine and the potential of any danger for the general public.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>The president has set aside a vast amount of resources to be prepared for the contingency. Several measures to be implemented by the Ministry of Health, specially regarding equipment for people infected and for health personnel. Other resources are being poured on R&amp;D trough National Council for Science and Technology to ensure that proper research is being focused into new treatment, potential cure and vaccination. All taking into account the information received by the experts in country.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>At national level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>there are some efforts form different ministries such as the Science and Technology Council trying to get facts and accurate information about the potential cure or vaccine for the virus. Also, to find out how different countries are fighting the disease and caring for the sick. Health ministry is constantly updating about the advances of the disease and the new cases. There are some researchers and technical experts that are finding new ways to fight or to improve the chances of the people, i.e. A company that was born at a research center is proving services to allow test to be performed more promptly and at lower cost,</td>

    <tr>
      <th>At international level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>There are many countries where high profile people is pouring in aid to alleviate the crisis. There plenty of trials that involve two or more countries to test new medicine and new ways of treatment. Researchers worldwide are working along with health companies to test new and old treatments such as interferon, hydroxcloroquine, and else. A trial in Seattle involving volunteers that had the virus was receiving aid and input from researchers across different countries.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What novel approaches, if any, is your country using to address the coronavirus crisis (e.g. use of machine learning, open science initiatives boosting access and sharing of data and research results, development and use of prediction models, etc.)?</th>
      <td>There are efforts being made using cutting edge technology to e.g. create equipment at low cost using 3D printing and other company is providing services to analiza samples at low cost and much less time to speed the process using diagnosis by DNA.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>The national Council for Science and Technology is planning to provide resources on specific research for the disease. In the short term we might see a decrease in activity first for the obligated quarantine but mostly because lack of resources that might need to be directed on patient care. CONACYT is working on   a long term plan on how to get more information from researchers and turn it into tangible results. That is why is pushing for a National Innovation Plan to be implemented on the medium term.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Is support of the STI system part of planned stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy?</th>
      <td>Yes, the government is widely conscious of the importance on research of STI. Therefore they allow the National Council for Science and Technology to prepare an agenda on the research plan for the next years. There is also a National Plan for Development that accounts for STI to improve socially and economically trough science and environmental care. Innovation in the country must be based on the care for the people (health, education, food security, etc.) and the care for the environment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Is there anything else regarding the STI policy response to Covid-19 in your country you would like to mention?</th>
      <td>We might need to have more plans in the long term if there is a second peak of the desease by the end of the year. We expect by then that there will be a cure or much scientific information about the medicine that will alleviate the symptoms. Researchers and health personnel must work focused on that, taking into account the differences of our population with other countries -genetically and in terms of resources, the geographical challenges our indigenous population face in terms of health care access, to mention some.</td>
