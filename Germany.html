      <td>Within the division of responsibilities in Germany’s federal system, in case of a pandemic the German Federation plays a coordinating role, promoting a unified approach to fighting the pandemic and running public information campaigns, as well as making recommendations to the federal states.<br><br>Based on the German Federal Government’s pandemic preparedness plan, a crisis task force jointly led by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI) and German Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) gathers all ministry-specific competences for combating the national threat posed by coronavirus (COVID-19).  As well as the BMI and BMG, the task force includes representatives of the German Federal Foreign Office, the German Federal Ministry of Defense, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, the German Federal Ministry of Finance, the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and the German Federal Chancellery.

Information on the novel Coronavirus and hygiene for the general public is available on the website of the German Federal Centre for Health Education https://www.bzga.de/home/bzga/.

      <th>In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>Germany is convinced that each nation will only win the race against this pandemic if we join forces in all areas, including research and development. EU Member States are closely working together and joining forces at EU-level.  The European Commission (DG RTD) has collected input from all member states on their R&amp;D activities. The European Commission is also organizing discussions with the ministries of the member states. (We assume that further information will be provided by the EU.) <br>Germany is also closely working together with G7- and G20-member states. <br><br>The recently adopted G7 Leaders’ statement expresses “our conviction that current challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic need a strongly coordinated international approach, based on science and evidence, consistent with our democratic values, and utilizing the strengths of private enterprise.” The G7 “will increase coordinated research efforts, including through voluntary support for the global alliance Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation.  We will support the launch of joint research projects funded by both public and private resources, and the sharing of facilities, towards rapid development, manufacture and distribution of treatments and a vaccine, adhering to the principles of efficacy, safety, and accessibility.”<br><br>Germany urges to increase investment in research and development for new vaccines, therapies and diagnostics, to strengthen international cooperation and to follow the recommendations of WHO.  Germany, for example, invites G20 countries to also support Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in their effort to develop a vaccine against SARS-Cov2. The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research decided to support CEPI  with additional 140 million € to support R&amp;D on new vaccines against Covid-19.<br><br>Germany exchanges information with other international state or philanthropic sponsors under the WHO umbrella in order to achieve the most targeted and coordinated investment possible for the research funds available worldwide. The co-operation with the “Global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness network” (GloPID-R) is most relevant.

      <td>Germany is aware of the need to avoid the dissemination of fake news and through the media and to intensify risk communication for the general public as well as for health care professionals. Therefore, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research set up a topic page about fake news and the new coronadisease COVID-19. As the virus spreads around the world, Germany is aware of the importance of getting accurate information about the disease. To combat misinformation the webpage is updated whenever the need arises and this information is spread through social media channels to counteract false information: https://www.bmbf.de/de/faktencheck-zum-coronavirus-11162.html</td>

      <th>At national level, what mechanisms are you developing or relying upon to bring together different STI actors (researchers, industry, government, health sector, foundations, etc.) to effectively collaborate on responses to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research is funding the development of a research network with 150 Mio. € in order to bundle and strengthen the research activities of German university medicine in the context of the current pandemic crisis. The initiative shall bring together and evaluate the action plans, diagnostic and treatment strategies of all German university clinics. At all university hospitals, the data of the treated COVID-19 patients are also systematically recorded and bundled in a database. In this way, the medical histories or data on the constitution of the patients can be merged. Scientists who are not active in medical research can also gain access to this data collection. Their research will flank the work of doctors. The data set will help generating valid and useful knowledge on the individual treatment of patients, pandemic management, but also with regard to vaccine and therapy development. The Federal Government will set up a task force. The task force will coordinate university medicine and politics. Various other scientific networks are also to be included.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>What impact on the STI system do you anticipate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and what measures are you implementing to address those?</th>
      <td>In the short term, there is a need for an “emergency funding for R&amp;I” to fully mobilize, involve and interconnect the available research capacities throughout Germany, Europe and the rest of the world. Evaluation and funding decisions should be fast and the bureaucratic burden of applicants must be minimized. All options for making project funding more flexible are to be used until further notice. The researchers and laboratories as well as the SMEs which are already active in the development of vaccines, drugs, diagnostics and treatment need financial support. If successful, support should be continued in the medium term to advance candidate products through clinical development. Also, immediate sharing of results and more urgently available data is crucial.<br>In the medium term, the contribution of digitization in the fight against virus pandemics is essential. Supercomputers and big data can effectively improve the simulation of disease spreading or the automatization of the analysis of targets for new drugs and treatments. Preparedness Networks e.g. of researchers, hospitals, clinics and diagnostic laboratories should receive continuous funding in order to have structures in place to rapidly respond to outbreaks.<br>In the long term, more basic and bottom-up research in virology end epidemiology is required. Sufficient support for fundamental research in life sciences and biomedicine as well as platform technologies should be mobilized.<br></td>
