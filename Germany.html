      <th>Q1B. In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>Germany is convinced that the Covid-19 pandemic can only be overcome by working together and joining forces internationally in all areas, including research and development. To this end, the Federal Government strongly promotes collaborative approaches and is actively participating in efforts to coordinate STI responses to Covid-19 on the EU level and beyond. <br><br>EU Level<br>EU Member States are closely working together and joining forces at EU level.  The European Commission (DG RTD) has collected input from all member states on their R&amp;D activities and is coordinating political responses at the level of the European Commission. President Ursula von der Leyen has established a Coronavirus response team to this end. These channels are also used to share objective information and data on the pandemic. <br><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-trav...</a> <br><br>Corona-Related R&amp;D policy in the context WHO, GloPID-R, and CEPI<br>Germany strongly supports and actively promotes international cooperation in the area of research and development for new vaccines, therapies and diagnostics. To this end, it has stepped up financial support of international organizations and networks that are dedicated to these aims. Germany is providing the World Health Organization (WHO) with additional financial support of 50 Mio. € for Covid-19. It also advises citizens and other states to follow the recommendations of the WHO. During the World Health Assembly on May 18, 2020, the Federal Ministry of Health also called for a reform of the WHO to strengthen its ability to coordinate responses and collect information and data faster in future health crises. <br><a href="https://www.who.int/about/planning-finance-and-accountability/financing-campaign/germany-impact" target="_blank">https://www.who.int/about/planning-finan...</a> <br><br>Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)<br>The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research is supporting the international Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) with an additional 140 Mio. € to promote R&amp;D on new vaccines against Covid-19.

In the event of the pandemic lasting for longer than this, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research will be authorized to issue an ordinance to extend the maximum fixed term of employment by a maximum of another six months with the approval of the Bundesrat.<br><br>The German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) is also supporting university students by facilitating rules and procedures regarding financial education and training assistance. The German National Association for Student Affairs (DSW) is provided by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research with 100 Mio. € for local student services emergency funds. This money is used to help those students who are suffering from particularly acute hardship and who need immediate help and do not have access to other forms of support.<br><br>Digital education<br>As an immediate measure to address pandemic-related gaps in education due to social distancing rules and mitigate negative effects on German STI systems, the German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) is advancing digitalization in education. Measures include opening 500 Mio. € from the DigitalPakt Schule to enable the German Länder to increase digital teaching provision during school closures until the end of 2020; extra funding of 500 Mio. € to enable schools to lend mobile digital devices to students who don’t have these at home; the expansion the BMBF’s ongoing “Hasso-Plattner-Institut” (HPI) School Cloud project to provide a digital learning environment for schools throughout the country; the launch of a “Wir bleiben Schlau!” (We stay smart!”) campaign to promote science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education at home through interlinked web programmes; and 500,000 € of short-term funding for Germany’s Adult Education Association (DVV).<br><a href="https://www.bmbf.de/en/coronavirus-what-the-bmbf-is-doing-11194.html" target="_blank">https://www.bmbf.de/en/coronavirus-what-...</a> <br><br>Online survey on research, development and innovation (R&amp;D&amp;I) activities of SMEs<br>In order to study the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on current and planned private-sector research, development, and innovation activities, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) conducted an online survey targeting innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). More than 1,800 companies took part in the survey. The results of the survey show that the vast majority of the firms plan to adapt their R&amp;D&amp;I activities due to the coronavirus pandemic. Three quarters would postpone or extend the duration of their R&amp;D&amp;I projects, 54% would temporarily interrupt projects and a quarter even abandon their projects. But results also show that three quarters of the consulted SMEs intend to continue or to start R&amp;D&amp;I activities to diversify their product(s) and service range. Digitalization of R&amp;D&amp;I activities will play a greater role in the future for about 50% of the SMEs. A further outcome is the need of support in strengthening entrepreneurial resilience (83%) and entrepreneurial innovation management (74%). In order to mitigate negative effects of the pandemic on innovative SMEs, BMWi has adjusted the framework conditions of project funding, e.g. allowing for more flexibility within existing innovation support schemes. <br><a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2020/20200409-how-is-the-coronavirus-affecting-research-and-innovation.html" target="_blank">https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressem...</a> <br></td>

      <th>Q6B. Is support of the STI system part of planned stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy?</th>
      <td>Initial wave of stabilization measures <br>The Federal Government has been developing and implementing a variety of measures of historic dimensions to stabilize the economy. In the initial wave of economic stabilization measures and short-term aid in the first two quarters of 2020, the German government sought to ease liquidity shortages and help companies of all sizes and sectors to secure their immediate survival, prevent layoffs, and protect assets. While these measures did not specifically target German STI systems, the broad and swift implementation of measures have been playing a crucial role in maintaining the foundations of STI in Germany as they contribute to keeping experienced teams together, avoiding layoffs of highly qualified workers, and securing intellectual and physical assets. All of these elements are key in sustaining innovation and R&amp;D in the future. <br><br>Economic Stimulus Package June 2020<br>In June 2020, the German Cabinet has adopted a broad, medium-term economic stimulus package worth 130 billion € that includes a temporary cut in value added tax, financial support for parents, and tax relief for companies to ensure liquidity. Germany considers research and innovation to be of vital importance for economic recovery and sustainability, which is why these areas play a crucial role in the package. To this aim, the programme is designed to revive the economy while simultaneously equipping Germany for the future through structural changes that will carry on well into the next decade. <br><br>Beyond its socioeconomic goals, the package is specifically geared towards research and measures promoting the research and development of seminal technologies as well as to mitigate climate change. A total of 50 billion € under the programme is earmarked for a package for the future. It includes tax breaks for research into the development of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Stepping up the use of hydrogen power and promoting electric mobility are also part of the package. <br><br>The fiscal measures aimed at the private sector are designed to enable companies to continue investments in research and development even during the crisis. To this end, the tax losses in 2020 and 2021 that may be offset against profits in previous years will be raised to 5 Mio. € per year. Furthermore, the assessment basis for fiscal research promotion is to be doubled to an annual total of 4 Mio. € per company until the end of 2025. <br><br>In order to protect innovative potential, the Federal Government is also assisting start-ups. Existing programmes are to be supplemented and additional funding is to be made available for public venture capital investors. Funds of up to 2 billion € have been earmarked to this end.<br><a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/search/corona-steuerhilfegesetz-1760128" target="_blank">https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/s...</a>  <br><br>Sub-federal measures<br>Due to the federal nature of Germany&#39;s political system, there are also a number of initiatives and measures below the federal level, on the level of the German Länder, that also affect Germany’s STI systems on a regional scale. To bolster the regional economy, most Länder have set up supplementary support programmes. These include broader plans such as “Soforthilfe Corona” plans to secure SME financing during the crisis, as well as more specific measures, such as Hamburg’s “HCS InnoStartup” which especially targets innovative startups. <br><br></td>
