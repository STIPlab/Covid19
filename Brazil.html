      <td>&#34;Rede Vírus-MCTIC - Among the initiatives the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication has carried out to support the fight against Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19), is the creation of an Experts Committee Rede Vírus-MCTIC (Virus-MCTIC Network) on Mar 11th 2020. The idea of creating this Network arose from a meeting held in early February 2020, with the aim of promoting a technical discussion of how science can help Brazil in tackling the problem of emerging viruses, especially the coronavirus. Scientists specialized in the area and representatives from the Ministry of Health participated in the debate. The Virus-MCTIC Network is already working to assist the Government in initial RD&amp;I actions to face this pandemic, as well as in the definition of research priorities related to COVID-19.<br><br> The Network plans to use MCTIC Research Units as CERTIFIERS for local producers so that they can manufacture materials to combat COVID-19. These Research Units are spread across Brazil and can respect the distinct nature of Brazilian regions, enabling the use of local sanitizing products, such as alcohol, detergents, masks, moist towels, etc.&#34;<br></td>

The objective of this working group is to share research results and information on how science can assist in the decisions and measures that we are taking to face the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.<br>Brazil has also joined UNESCO&#39;s Virtual Ministerial Dialogue on COVID-19 and Open Science.</td>

      <td>&#34;On March 25th, an extraordinary credit of R$ 100 millon (~ USD 20 million) has been approved from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FNDCT - Fundo Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico).  Funds will be used to promote research projects related to coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. This resource will be used for emergency support of projects (grants) within the scope of the priorities defined by the Virus-MCTIC Network, including:<br>* Development of diagnostic kits;<br>* Development of vaccine candidates;<br>* Use of advanced technologies for rapid selection of possible drugs;<br>* Large-scale sequencing and monitoring of mutations in SARS-Cov 2 (COVID-19) samples;<br>* Structuring a virus sample bank for scientific studies to understand the disease.<br><br>In addition, this resource will be used to support an Open Call (grant) in partnership with the Ministry of Health, to be launched via CNPq (National Reseacrh Council). The purpose of the call is to support STI in the areas of prevention, control and combating COVID-19 and other respiratory syndromes.<br><br>Overall priority is given to the development of a) medications and respective pre-clinical and clinical tests; b) vaccines and respective pre-clinical and clinical tests; c) innovation for the production in large scale of ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) and their related systems; Research, development and innovation in diagnostic tests are also a priority; monitoring and sequencing the virus genome circulating in the country; telemedicine tools.<br><br>To this end, the MCTIC will carry out: I - direct contracting of projects, studies, technologies and innovations; II - public call (s) for contracting projects, studies, technologies and innovations; and III - coordination between organizations in the science, technology, innovation and communications system.<br><br>The National Postal Service Company (Correios) is acting as the logistics Partner for the Virus-MCTIC Network, being responsible for collecting viral material (new coronavirus and influenza) from selected laboratories and delivering them to other labs (in-kind contribution). These  are being used in studies on contagion, proliferation of viruses and vaccines for diseases. Scientists working on the matter now have priority in receiving and sending research material, since time is crucial for the effectiveness of research with COVID-19.<br><br>The Ministry of Health Authorized the use of telemedicine to care for patients with coronavirus (March 23rd, 2020)&#34;<br><br>The Brazilian Company of Research and Industrial Innovation (EMBRAPII) has increased its share in non-refundable finance (previously up to 1/3 of the total funding) to innovation projects related to COVID-19. It is also providing additional funding of up to R$ 6 million (~US$ 1.2 million)  in partnership with the Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Service (SEBRAE) to fund innovation projects related to the diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 to startups and SMEs (<a href="https://embrapii.org.br/embrapii-e-sebrae-destinam-recursos-para-startups-durante-crise-do-coronavirus/" target="_blank">https://embrapii.org.br/embrapii-e-sebra...</a>)<br><br>The Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) is providing additional funding of up to R$ 10 million (~US$ 2 million) to the redirection of research projects already underway to focus on COVID-19 (<a href="http://www.fapesp.br/en/14122" target="_blank">http://www.fapesp.br/en/14122</a>). <br><br>FINEP, in partnership with FAPESP, has launched a joint call of R$ 20 million (~US$ 4 million) to fund innovation projects related to COVID-19 developed by SMEs in the state of Sao Paulo.</td>
