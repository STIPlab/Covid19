Three research areas, in line with the priorities agreed at the recent Coronavirus Research Roundtable, are vaccine development, anti-viral development and respiratory medicine research<br><br><br>On 21 March 2020, the Australian Government announced the investment of more than $2.6 million in cutting-edge diagnostics (https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/26-million-for-coronavirus-research-including-a-new-simpler-australian-pathology-test) research at the Peter Doherty Institute. The funding, from the Medical Research Future Fund, will be used to help maximise Australia’s capacity to test patients for the coronavirus. Four projects will be funded: <br>•\tThe development of a new simpler Australian coronavirus pathology test that will address forecast extraction reagent supply issues through a technique that uses locally manufactured reagents and a different chemistry to current testing methodologies. This new methodology would enable a result within 30 minutes of receipt of a specimen with minimal manual handling.  <br>•\tThe development of new coronavirus testing protocols to enable more individuals to be tested simultaneously, while minimising the number of consumables used and maintain the current turnaround times. This is a one-step test which can be produced and carried out in Australia. <br>•\tThe development of a deployment framework for newly approved coronavirus serology tests. Serology tests can be used to retrospectively diagnose patients who have recovered from the coronavirus or who have an asymptomatic infection. <br>•\tPost-market assessment of new coronavirus rapid screening tests to inform their best use.https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/26-million-for-coronavirus-research-including-a-new-simpler-australian-pathology-test<br><br>The TGA is fast tracking (ie: accelerating) regulatory assessment for applications for a therapeutic good related to COVID-19. In some cases, for example point of care tests, due to limited information at the time of application, regulatory approval is granted, with strict conditions that follow-up data and studies including stability shelf-life is provided to the TGA.  In addition, a number of exemptions for complying with normal regulatory processes and approvals are in place to facilitate faster access and supply for some tests and PPE medical devices. <br>•\tTherapeutic Goods (Medical Devices—Accredited Pathology Laboratories) (COVID-19 Emergency) Exemption 2020 (F2020N00032);(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00032/Download)  and<br>•\tTherapeutic Goods (Medical Devices—Face Masks and Other Articles) (COVID-19 Emergency) Exemption 2020 (F2020N00033).(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00033/Download) <br><br>https://www.tga.gov.au/legal-supply-covid-19-diagnostic-tests<br><br><br>NHMRC funds a Centre of Research Excellence dedicated to emergency pandemic response – The Australian Partnership for Preparedness Research on Infectious Disease Emergencies (APPRISE).

      <td>The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is Australia’s national science research agency. CSIRO has received funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global group that aims to speed up the development of vaccines and cut short the COVID-19 pandemic. CSIRO will receive vaccine candidates agreed by CEPI and begin testing of new potential vaccines and therapeutics to see if they work and are safe. The vaccine developments themselves are being partially funded by CEPI in laboratories around the world including Australia. CSIRO is working closely with the University of Queensland and the Doherty Institute.<br><br>CSIRO is also part of a separate consortium established with the University of Queensland in 2019 to rapidly develop vaccines. The consortium was established to create a rapid response pipeline to develop and test new vaccines. The consortium has been tasked by CEPI to develop a vaccine platform for nCoV-2019 in collaboration with CSIRO.</td>
