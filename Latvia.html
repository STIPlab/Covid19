      <td>- EUR 5,000,000 State Research Program (SRP) for Covid-19 research in the fields of health, engineering, society, and the economy. The SRP is planned to be implemented by the end of 2020 in the form of interdisciplinary research projects, with a special emphasis on information and technology and economic components. SRP projects would focus on research topics such as viral biomedical research, new forms of work and education, digital tools and platforms, remote medical services, psychology and families, post-Covid-19 health effects, clinical recommendations for drugs and vaccines, and other Covid-19 related mitigation issues.<br><br>- EUR 500,000 from the European Regional Development Fund for Covid-19 epidemiological research;<br><br>- EUR 400,000 [initially earmarked, actual amount will not exceed EUR 150,000] NordFosk research project competition on the use of Nordic health data to combat and mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic. The competition provides for the use of existing clinical, socio-economic, statistical, and other data, the acquisition of new data, and the facilitation of cross-border data exchange. In order for the project to be included in the competition, Latvian scientific institutions will have to cooperate in an international consortium with at least two Nordic partners.</td>
