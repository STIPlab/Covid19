      <td>The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is Australia’s national science research agency. CSIRO has received funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global group that aims to speed up the development of vaccines and cut short the COVID-19 pandemic. CSIRO will receive vaccine candidates agreed by CEPI and begin testing of new potential vaccines and therapeutics to see if they work and are safe. The vaccine developments themselves are being partially funded by CEPI in laboratories around the world including Australia. CSIRO is working closely with the University of Queensland and the Doherty Institute.<br><br>CSIRO is also part of a separate consortium established with the University of Queensland in 2019 to rapidly develop vaccines. The consortium was established to create a rapid response pipeline to develop and test new vaccines. The consortium has been tasked by CEPI to develop a vaccine platform for nCoV-2019 in collaboration with CSIRO.</td>

      <td>The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the Finnish institute of Health and Welfare are liaising strongly with the ECDC and WHO. The Finnish R&amp;I sector is working closely together with its European and Global counterparts on the COVID19 to find ways to respond to the epidemic by using and leveraging on the existing collaborations, partnerships and projects (for example funded through European Commission.  A total of EUR 5 million is proposed for Finland's participation in the research and development of a COVID-19 vaccine: 4 million euros to CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation) and 1 million euros to IVI (International Vaccine Institute).</td>
