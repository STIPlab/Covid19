CSIRO has received funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global group that aims to speed up the development of vaccines and cut short the COVID-19 pandemic. CSIRO will receive vaccine candidates agreed by CEPI and begin testing of new potential vaccines and therapeutics to see if they work and are safe. The vaccine developments themselves are being partially funded by CEPI in laboratories around the world including Australia. CSIRO is working closely with the University of Queensland and the Doherty Institute.<br><br>CSIRO is also part of a separate consortium established with the University of Queensland in 2019 to rapidly develop vaccines. The consortium was established to create a rapid response pipeline to develop and test new vaccines. The consortium has been tasked by CEPI to develop a vaccine platform for nCoV-2019 in collaboration with CSIRO.</td>

The European Commission will also establish that all the publications supported by EU R&amp;I funds should be open access, excepting the rules of commercial publication rights. At the suggestion of Australia, Spain has supported the study of the possibility of also exempting global patent regulation, with the aim of speeding up the licensing and technology transfer processes, in order to manufacture certain products worldwide.<br><br>In the framework of the remote activity most of the European Groups, Committees and Initiatives continuing developing during this time of isolation, many of them are intended to share initiatives put in place and exchange lessons learnt in the different European and third countries in different domains in relation the COVID-19, e.g. in ESFRI context, an exercise has been launched to know how national Research Infrastructures are managing the crisis and what resources are offering to work in the different aspects related to the health crisis, in this sense the direct actors are national delegates, Ministerial or Funding Agencies public employees, responsible for the RIs policies in their corresponding countries in base information gathered from national RIs managers and users.<br></td>

Switzerland will contribute to this platform as soon as more information is available.<br><br>Many activities of individual organisations are going on. One example: In response to the Covid-19 crisis, EMBL-EBI is offering new services and especially Data Hub resources to the scientists from Member States. The Swiss community has been informed of the possibility and has shown interest in using the new services. The international research organisations in the area of life sciences (EMBL but also others like ELIXIR) have responded to the crisis not only by locking down most of their infrastructure to protect the staff but also by adopting strategies and offering new services in order to contribute to the ongoing research efforts to resolve the crisis.<br></td>
