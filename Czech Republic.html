      <th>Q1A. What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>The National Security Council (hereinafter referred to as „NSC“) is a standing body of the Czech Government responsible for coordinating the Czech Republic’s security issues and preparing draft measures to ensure the country’s security. The Czech Government establishes, in support of its activities and decisions, advisory and working bodies, made up of members of the governmental institutions and other experts. They may be established either as permanent or temporary bodies (<a href="https://www.vlada.cz/en/pracovni-a-poradni-organy-vlady/brs/office-of-the-government-of-the-czech-republic-23851/" target="_blank">https://www.vlada.cz/en/pracovni-a-porad...</a>). <br><br>In cases of serious infectious diseases, the NSC is activated and other members in accordance with their specialized professional focus become a part of it. This is the case of the Central Epidemiological Commission (hereinafter referred to as „CEC“) for recent coronavirus SARS CoV-2 / COVID-19 crisis. The CEC is chaired by Minister of Health and is composed of 21 members (representatives of the main public stakeholders). External collaborators, experts in the field of medicine and/or scientific community, have been invited to cooperate in dealing with the current emergency too. <br><br>The Research, Development and Innovation Council (hereinafter referred to as “CRDI”) is the main advisory body to the Government of the Czech Republic in the area of RDI. The CRDI is chaired by Prime Minister and is composed of a team of experts from various fields of academia, industry and RDI policy stakeholders. <br><br></td>

    <tr>
      <th>Q1B. In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>The Ministry of Health is in close contact with national medical experts and scientists in relevant fields as well as with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and World Health Organisation (WHO). The connection with those and many other platforms allows for using the most up-to-date information on the latest developments and related recommendations for dealing with the situation at the Czech national level. <br><br>The Czech Republic is a Member State of a number of international research infrastructures and is thus engaged with the efforts that the research community is developing in response to the SARS-CoV-2 / Covid-19 pandemic. Whether these are international R&amp;D organizations  established under public international law (<a href="https://www.vyzkumne-infrastruktury.cz/en/international-research-organisations/" target="_blank">https://www.vyzkumne-infrastruktury.cz/e...</a>) or European research infrastructures cosortia  (ERIC) established under the EU legal framework (<a href="https://www.vyzkumne-infrastruktury.cz/en/eric/" target="_blank">https://www.vyzkumne-infrastruktury.cz/e...</a>), the Czech Republic fights Covid-19 as an active Member of the world leading laboratories (<a href="https://www.vyzkumne-infrastruktury.cz/en/2020/04/czechia-as-a-member-of-international-research-infrastructures-in-response-to-sars-cov-2-covid-19/" target="_blank">https://www.vyzkumne-infrastruktury.cz/e...</a>).<br></td>

    <tr>
      <th>Q2.Do you have dedicated arrangements in place for communicating science advice and for refuting misleading information to the public on Covid-19?</th>
      <td>Several approaches and examples can be mentioned:<br>• The Czech Government and each Ministry have its own official website where progress reports on the coronavirus pandemic situation are regularly updated and where information and advice based on analytics are also placed. <br>• The Ministry of Health created website for communication with the general public (<a href="https://www.mzcr.cz/cizinci/dokumenty/questions-and-answers-in-relation-to-the-coronavirus-in-the-czech-republic_18649_2649_23.html" target="_blank">https://www.mzcr.cz/cizinci/dokumenty/qu...</a>). It also launched the website in collaboration with IBM chatbot, so called virtual nurse Agnes (Anežka), which continuosly apears on other official sites. <br>• The Czech Academy of Sciences (hereinafter reffered to as „CAS“) – experts from numerous institutes of CAS assist with testing of samples for the new type of the coronavirus and analyse materials for the production of breathing masks and respirators. All news related to the CAS’s assistance in the struggle against the contagion can be found at <a href="http://www.avcr.cz/en/news-archive/The-Czech-Academy-of-Sciences-tests-samples-develops-new-tests-and-advises-with-economics/" target="_blank">http://www.avcr.cz/en/news-archive/The-C...</a>.<br></td>
