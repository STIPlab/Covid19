      <th>Q1A. What arrangements, if any, do you have in place to ensure scientific advice informs national policy and decision making in relation to Covid-19?</th>
      <td>The National Security Council (hereinafter referred to as „NSC“) is a standing body of the Czech Government responsible for coordinating the Czech Republic’s security issues and preparing draft measures to ensure the country’s security. The Czech Government establishes, in support of its activities and decisions, advisory and working bodies, made up of members of the governmental institutions and other experts. They may be established either as permanent or temporary bodies (<a href="https://www.vlada.cz/en/pracovni-a-poradni-organy-vlady/brs/office-of-the-government-of-the-czech-republic-23851/" target="_blank">https://www.vlada.cz/en/pracovni-a-porad...</a>). <br><br>In cases of serious infectious diseases, the NSC is activated and other members in accordance with their specialized professional focus become a part of it. This is the case of the Central Epidemiological Commission (hereinafter referred to as „CEC“) for recent coronavirus SARS CoV-2 / COVID-19 crisis. The CEC is chaired by Minister of Health and is composed of 21 members (representatives of the main public stakeholders). External collaborators, experts in the field of medicine and/or scientific community, have been invited to cooperate in dealing with the current emergency too. <br><br>The Research, Development and Innovation Council (hereinafter referred to as “CRDI”) is the main advisory body to the Government of the Czech Republic in the area of RDI.

It provides a wide range of measures constituting a response to the current pandemic. One of the key instruments of implementation of the Action Plan is already the 8th EU Framework Program for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 (2014-2020), in which the first specifically targeted call has led to funding of a total of 18 European research projects focused on diagnostics, vaccines and drugs development against Covid-19 in the total amount reaching nearly 50 million EUR (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/health-research-and-innovation/coronavirus-research-and-innovation_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-i...</a>). <br><br>The Technology Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic is the national information centre for European RDI, and has created a website on information about European RDI opportunities in relation to Covid-19 (<a href="https://www.tc.cz/en" target="_blank">https://www.tc.cz/en</a>).<br> <br>The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (hereinafrer referred to as „ESFRI“) is putting all its effort in helping to coordinate actions and investments among research infrastructures at the European and national levels for the development of diagnostic tools, treatments and vaccines, as well as the analysis of the economic and social impacts of the implemented confinement measures. ESFRI is helping the scientific community by gathering information about dedicated services offered by research infrastructures and communicating all relevant actions as broadly as possible (<a href="https://www.esfri.eu/covid-19" target="_blank">https://www.esfri.eu/covid-19</a>). <br><br>Participation of the Czech Republic on the international global level takes place within organizations such as WHO (<a href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/home" target="_blank">http://www.euro.who.int/en/home</a>) or UNESCO<br>(<a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/unesco-mobilizes-122-countries-promote-open-science-and-reinforced-cooperation-face" target="_blank">https://reliefweb.int/report/world/unesc...</a>). <br></td>

Loans are granted up to 90 % of eligible expenditure with a maturity of 2 years, including the possibility of deferred repayment for up to 12 months. The loan may be used, for example, for the acquisition of small tangible or intangible assets, the acquisition and financing of inventories or for other operating expenses and expenditures. There are no fees associated with the processing and granting of the loan or its possible early repayment. Applicants for the COVID Loan will benefit from this interest-free financing, if their contractual performance has been delayed, suspended or cancelled due to measures taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection (<a href="https://www.cmzrb.cz/podnikatele/uvery/uver-covid/" target="_blank">https://www.cmzrb.cz/podnikatele/uvery/u...</a>). <br><br>• The guarantee program COVID II was the next one in a series of upcoming supports announced by the CMZRB (<a href="https://www.cmzrb.cz/podnikatele/uvery/uver-covid/" target="_blank">https://www.cmzrb.cz/podnikatele/uvery/u...</a>).<br><br>• The CMZRB in cooperation with the MIT, Capitol of Prague and commercial banks prepared further guarantee schemes such as COVID Prague and/or COVID III.
