This information is the result of an analysis of data collected by the different actors who are leading the fight against COVID-19 in Colombia, presented in a way the public would find pedagogical and easy to understand.  This material is released in collaboration with various actors from the National STI System and other government entities through websites, social networks and other digital media, in order to empower the audiences who access and share this content.<br><br>ii) Second, the creation of live, online, participatory dialogues with experts. These spaces allow experts to address some of the most common misunderstandings about the virus and the crisis it has caused, using examples and technical explanations. For this exercise, users can submit questions through social networks, fostering a participatory and dynamic dialogue where citizens are represented. These dialogues are broadcast regularly throughout the period of quarantine declared by the national government.<br><br>iii) Finally, a special edition will be produced entitled &#34;The Coronavirus from different views of the Sciences&#34; with about 10 different texts and related audiovisual material. This will be an opportunity to make an in-depth reading of the current situation through the viewpoints of different areas of knowledge in relation to COVID-19. This material will be released in approximately 3 weeks, in collaboration with actors of the National STI System and other government entities including the Ministry of Health and shared through their digital media, in order to widen its public reach.<br></td>

DG COMM set up a ‘Fighting disinformation’ corner under the Commission’s Coronavirus response website. DG R&amp;I has flagged multiple instances of harmful narratives, and developed and disseminated resources helpful in countering misinformation.

On 20 March 2020, the consumer protection (CPC) authorities of the Member States, with the support of the Commission, issued CPC Common Position COVID-19 on the most reported scams and unfair practices in this context.
