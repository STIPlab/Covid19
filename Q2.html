These spaces allow experts to address some of the most common misunderstandings about the virus and the crisis it has caused, using examples and technical explanations. For this exercise, users can submit questions through social networks, fostering a participatory and dynamic dialogue where citizens are represented. These dialogues are broadcast regularly throughout the period of quarantine declared by the national government.<br><br>iii) Finally, a special edition will be produced entitled &#34;The Coronavirus from different views of the Sciences&#34; with about 10 different texts and related audiovisual material.
