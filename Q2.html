Those briefings are also used to clarify misunderstandings and to fight back attempts to deviate from the lockdown conditions and rumours. <br><br>Concerning misinformation, Belgium, through its Centre for Cybersecurity, tries to alert people against misleading communication about the coronavirus and provides links to the Belgian sites where official reports are available. The Centre also developed some tools, like an on-line test that you can try in order to see if you can recognise phishing (see https://www.safeonweb.be/en/quiz/phishing-test). <br><br>At regional level, there are also important initiatives; e.g.: the Flemish agency of Care and Health (agentschap Zorg en gezondheid) created a  dedicated fact check webpage on the ‘health and science’ website (https://www.gezondheidenwetenschap.be/dossiers/coronavirus) to help debunking the fake news on COVID-19.<br></td>

      <td>● COVID-19 Content Production Strategy<br><br>With the aim of providing true information and undermining false beliefs around COVID-19, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation has undertaken an intersectoral strategy of Public Communication of Science and Public Outreach. This strategy includes the following specific components:<br>i) First, the production of infographics and digital videographies from the technical inputs provided by high-level experts, who participate in an ongoing series of dialogues organized by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia to discuss matters related to COVID-19. This information is the result of the analysis of data collected by the different actors who are leading the fight against COVID-19 in Colombia, presented in a way the public would find pedagogical and easy to understand.  This material is released in collaboration with various actors from the National STI System and other government entities through websites, social networks and other digital media, in order to empower the audiences who access and share this content.<br>ii) Second, the creation of live, on-line, participatory dialogues with experts. These spaces allow experts to address some of the most common misunderstandings about the virus and the crisis it has caused, using examples and technical explanations. For this exercise, users can submit questions through social networks, fostering a participatory and dynamic dialogue where citizens are represented. These dialogues are broadcast regularly throughout period of quarantine declared by the national government.<br>iii) Finally, a special edition will be produced entitled "The Coronavirus from different views of the Sciences" with about 10 different texts and related audiovisual material. This will be an opportunity to make an in-depth reading of the current situation through the viewpoints of different areas of knowledge in relation to COVID-19. This material will be released in approximately 3 weeks, in collaboration with actors of the National STI System and other government entities including the Ministry of Health and shared through their digital media, in order to widen its public reach.<br></td>
