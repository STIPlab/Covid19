      <th>Q1B. In what ways, if any, are you coordinating on Covid-19 STI responses at international level?</th>
      <td>The Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) is enhancing its monitoring of the financial sector and, in cooperation with European and Finnish authorities, has adopted measures to promote access to funding and the smooth functioning of the markets despite the pandemic. The FIN-FSA confirms, in line with the decisions taken by the European Central Bank, that banks are temporarily exempt from fulfilling certain additional capital and liquidity requirements. This will facilitate credit institutions’ ability to provide funding to non-financial corporations and households and will alleviate the negative economic effects of the pandemic. The Board of the FIN-FSA has started work on an immediate review of the level of capital requirements that are subject to national decision-making.

      <th>Q3. What new STI policy measures, if any, is your country taking to respond specifically to the Covid-19 crisis?</th>
      <td>Please note that the response to this question is overlapping somewhat with the issues asked in question 6. We often find it difficult to make a difference between the actions and stimulus packages aimed at supporting the economy in general and on the innovation system in particular. Here is a summary of Covid-19 –related measures, organized by the authority responsible for the measures.<br><br>1) The Bank of Finland made decisions on 15 March 2020 on measures aimed at alleviating payment difficulties and liquidity shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring access to funding for households and businesses, particularly SMEs. The decisions were prepared in cooperation with the Government and key authorities, and in dialogue with the financial sector. They complement the decisions taken earlier by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) to support favourable liquidity conditions and preserve the smooth provision of credit in the euro area.<br><br>The Bank of Finland assesses, in close cooperation with national, European and Nordic authorities, the stability of the financial system and, in particular, developments in financial intermediation. The purpose is to facilitate the ability of credit institutions to provide funding to businesses and households and to mitigate the negative economic impact of the pandemic. The Board of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) has started work on an immediate review of the level of capital requirements that are subject to national decision-making.<br><br>In 2009–2018, the Bank of Finland invested in the domestic corporate paper market. This investment activity was discontinued as market volumes shrank, reflecting the decrease in funding needs of businesses. Recent events have weakened the ability of markets to function and increased the funding needs of businesses. The Bank of Finland has therefore decided to restart its activities in the domestic corporate paper markets. The size of the programme was initially EUR 500 million. A few days later, the size of the programme was increased to EUR 1 billion due to huge demand.<br><br>For more, see: <a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/media-and-publications/releases/2020/the-bank-of-finland-decided-on-new-measures-to-safeguard-funding-for-businesses-and-households-during-the-corona-virus-pandemic/" target="_blank">https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/media-and...</a><br><br>2) The Tax Administration will ease the terms of payment arrangements for the time being. If a company has difficulties paying taxes due to the coronavirus situation, it can request a payment arrangement with eased terms starting 25 March 2020. For example, according to the new terms, the first installment of the payment arrangement will fall due in three months after the arrangement has become active, as opposed to just one month.<br><br>See: <a href="https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/newsroom/corona-situation/" target="_blank">https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/newsroom...</a><br><br>3) The Government decided on 20 March on an extensive package to support companies and to alleviate the negative effects of the coronavirus epidemic (See press release: <a href="https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/hallitukselta-mittava-paketti-yritysten-tueksi-finnveran-kautta-10-miljardin-euron-lisarahoitus-yrityksille" target="_blank">https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publis...</a>). <br>According to a government decision, 1,500 foreign seasonal workers can be employed to perform agricultural, forestry, horticultural and fishery work. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has provided the Finnish Border Guard a list of the most critical employees in terms of security of supply.  Legislative amendments to legislation concerning the right of third-country nationals to work in duties central to the security of supply and the functioning of the labour market entered into force on 9 April 2020. <br><br><a href="https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/kausitoihin-tarjolla-tyontekijoita-myos-suomessa" target="_blank">https://tem.fi/en/article/-/asset_publis...</a><br><br>4) Ministry of Social Affairs and Health: The Government submitted the first supplementary budget proposal for 2020 to Parliament on 20 March. An additional appropriation of EUR 12.8 million is proposed for the operating expenses of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare for the expenditure arising from the coronavirus. The additional appropriation is intended for purposes such as disseminating information and raising awareness among citizens, for safeguarding the functioning of information systems and for maintaining laboratory capacity. Altogether, EUR 6 million of the additional appropriation will be allocated to a broad-based research consortium for research into the coronavirus epidemic, in particular for developing rapid diagnostic methods and research into the emergence of immunity and for creating a national monitoring system for it. Of the additional funding allocated to research, EUR 4 million will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.<br><br><br>5) Organisations operating in the field of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE Group) monitor the effects of the coronavirus on businesses, employment, consumers and security of supply. The Ministry together with other organisations in the MEAE Group, monitors the effects of the coronavirus on business activities, employment and security of supply, and takes the necessary measures to alleviate the negative impacts.

These services are intended for SMEs and midcaps operating in Finland whose business is suffering from the coronavirus situation. Financial services are intended for at least tourism and auxiliary tourism services, creative and performing industries and all sectors where subcontracting chains are affected. The funding is intended for companies to explore and tap into new business opportunities in emergency conditions. The first funding decisions were made immediately on 20 March 2020.<br><br>7) Finnvera (<a href="https://www.finnvera.fi/eng/" target="_blank">https://www.finnvera.fi/eng/</a>)<br>The Government will make additional financing of EUR 10 billion available to businesses through Finnvera. The principal operating model is offering guarantees to banks that grant loans. In addition, the state will increase its coverage of Finnvera’s credit and guarantee losses from 50% to 80%.<br><br>8) ELY Centres (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) (<a href="https://www.ely-keskus.fi/en/web/ely-en/" target="_blank">https://www.ely-keskus.fi/en/web/ely-en/...</a>)<br>ELY Centres’ grant authorisations for business development projects will be increased by EUR 50 million. The additional authorisation will be used to support SMEs particularly in the service sector but also in other sectors as necessary to manage and prevent the effects of the coronavirus.<br><br>9) VTT – Technical Research Center (<a href="https://www.vttresearch.com/en" target="_blank">https://www.vttresearch.com/en</a>)<br>VTT is responding to corona virus in various ways, including the following:<br><br>9.1 Responding to customer needs in exceptional circumstances<br>Through active and continuous communication, VTT enables the understanding of customer needs even in exceptional circumstances. All customer meetings have been converted to online meetings. Plans to help clients monitor the progress of their daily experimental work at VTT, for example, have been developed and are being implemented. VTT&#39;s new, streamlined website has been launched. In addition, social media and other digital marketing channels are actively used for communication. As an example, VTT utilizes webinars and recordings of VTT researchers&#39; presentations to enable scientific exchange despite the prevailing conditions.<br><br>9.2 Immediate RTD actions to assist Finnish society during covid-19<br>During the Corona pandemic, VTT sees opportunities to participate in a joint national effort by leveraging the organization&#39;s expertise and available infrastructure. VTT has identified capabilities that would provide immediate national support for the Corona effort, as well as expertise that will bring significant benefits over the next year. Recognized examples include some with immediate effect, some requiring more time and also additional investments.<br><br>9.3 Measures to mitigate the economic shock and support national competitiveness<br>VTT has started planning how VTT&#39;s research resources can be harnessed to maintain Finland&#39;s competitiveness in this exceptional situation. As client assignments fade, VTT&#39;s freed up researcher resources can be utilized (subject to an increase in state aid) for strategic themes and projects that benefit Finnish industry and society and revitalize economic growth. VTT has the capability to launch such research projects quickly. The themes will not only address the challenges posed by the corona situation in terms of industrial competitiveness and security of supply, but will also continue to focus on providing solutions to the long-term challenges of carbon neutrality and the circular economy. Innovations related to these themes will also benefit Finland after the immediate corona crisis eased.<br><br><br>10) The Academy of Finland is making available funding for Covid-19 research (3 million euros) The aims of the funding to be granted for research into the COVID-19 epidemic are:<br>• to support research in the field and/or<br>• to improve open access to research data and outputs for researchers and society and/or<br>• to promote the use of research knowledge in mitigating the effects and/or<br>• to promote the utilisation of research-based knowledge and expertise.<br>The call is a targeted call intended for organisations. The organisation’s application consists of sub-applications. The sub-applications are based on the work of ongoing Academy-funded projects, which will ensure that activities can start as soon as possible. The plans of the sub-applications must be relevant to the theme of the call. The principal investigators of the sub-applications must have an ongoing Academy-funded research project on the closing date of the call.<br>The assessment will focus on how the plans are based on the work of the projects, their relevance to the theme of the call and whether the plan can be credibly implemented considering the current situation. The General Subcommittee of the Academy of Finland will make the funding decisions.<br><a href="https://www.aka.fi/en/about-us/media/press-releases/2020/academy-of-finland-opens-special-call-for-applications-for-research-into-covid-19/" target="_blank">https://www.aka.fi/en/about-us/media/pre...</a><br><br>11) CSC-Center for Scientific Computing gives priority to its computation capacity for national health care organizations.<br></td>
